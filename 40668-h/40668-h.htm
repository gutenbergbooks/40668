<h1>A QUARTER-BACK&rsquo;S PLUCK</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<h3>MOVING DAY</h3>


<p>Phil Clinton looked critically at the rickety
old sofa. Then he glanced at his chum, Tom
Parsons. Next he lifted, very cautiously, one end
of the antiquated piece of furniture. The sofa
bent in the middle, much as does a ship with a
broken keel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it looks like a mighty risky job to move it,
Tom,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s broken right through the
center.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it is,&rdquo; admitted Tom sorrowfully. Then
he lifted the head of the sofa, and warned by an
ominous creaking, he lowered it gently to the floor
of the college room which he and his chum, Sid
Henderson, were about to leave, with the assistance
of Phil Clinton to help them move. &ldquo;Poor
old sofa,&rdquo; went on Tom. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a hard life.
I&rsquo;m afraid your days are numbered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not going to leave it here, for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
measly freshman to lie on, are you, Tom?&rdquo; asked
Phil anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; was the quick response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor the old chair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor the alarm clock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never! Even if it doesn&rsquo;t keep time, and goes
off in the middle of the night. No, Phil, we&rsquo;ll take
&rsquo;em along to our new room. But, for the life of
me, I don&rsquo;t see how we&rsquo;re going to move that sofa.
It will collapse if we lift both ends at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so, but we&rsquo;ve got to take it, even if
we move it in sections, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, only I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; cried Phil suddenly. &ldquo;I know how
to do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splice it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splice it? What do you think it is&mdash;a rope
ladder? You must be in love, or getting over the
measles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I mean just what I say. We&rsquo;ll splice it.
You wait. I&rsquo;ll go down cellar, and get some pieces
of board from the janitor. Also a hammer and
some nails. We&rsquo;ll save the old sofa yet, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, go ahead. More power to ye, as
Bricktop Molloy would say. I wonder if he&rsquo;s
coming back this term?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep. Post graduate course, I hear. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
wouldn&rsquo;t miss the football team for anything.
Well, you hold down things here until I come back.
If the new freshmen who are to occupy this room
come along, tell &rsquo;em we&rsquo;ll be moved by noon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt it; but go ahead. I&rsquo;ll try to be comfortable
until your return, dearest,&rdquo; and with a
mocking smile Tom Parsons sank down into an
easy chair that threatened to collapse under his
substantial bulk. From the faded cushions a cloud
of dust arose, and set Tom to sneezing so hard
that the old chair creaked and rattled, as if it
would fall apart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy! Easy there, old chap!&rdquo; exclaimed the
tall, good-looking lad, as he peered on either side
of the seat. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go back on me now. You&rsquo;ll
soon have a change of climate, and maybe that
will be good for your old bones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He settled back, stuck his feet out before him,
and gazed about the room. It was a very much
dismantled apartment. In the center was piled a
collection of baseball bats, tennis racquets, boxing
gloves, foils, catching gloves, a football, some running
trousers, a couple of sweaters, and a nondescript
collection of books. There were also a
couple of trunks, while, flanking the pile, was the
old sofa and the arm chair. On top of all the
alarm clock was ticking comfortably away, as happy
as though moving from one college dormitory to
another was a most matter-of-fact proceeding. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
hands pointed to one o&rsquo;clock, when it was, as Tom
ascertained by looking at his watch, barely nine;
but a little thing like that did not seem to give the
clock any concern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do hope Phil can rig up some scheme so we
can move the sofa,&rdquo; murmured the occupant of the
easy chair. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s like part of ourselves now.
It will make the new room seem more like home.
I wonder where Sid can be? This is more of his
moving than it is Phil&rsquo;s, but Sid always manages
to get out of hard work. Phil is anxious to room
with us, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Parsons stretched his legs out a little farther,
and let his gaze once more roam about the
room. Suddenly he uttered an exclamation, as his
eye caught sight of something on the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Came near forgetting that,&rdquo; he said as he arose,
amid another cloud of dust from the chair, and
removed from a spot on the wall, behind the door,
the picture of a pretty girl. &ldquo;I never put that
there,&rdquo; he went on, as he wiped the dust from the
photograph, and turned it over to look at the name
written on the back&mdash;Madge Tyler. &ldquo;Sid must
have done that for a joke. He thought I&rsquo;d forget
it, and leave it for some freshy to make fun of.
Not much! I got ahead of you that time, Sid, my
boy. Queer how he doesn&rsquo;t like girls,&rdquo; added Tom,
with the air of an expert. &ldquo;Well, probably it&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
just as well he doesn&rsquo;t take too much to Madge,
for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Tom&rsquo;s musings, which were getting rather
sentimental, were interrupted by the entrance of
Phil Clinton. Phil had under one arm some boards,
while in one hand he carried a hammer, and in the
other some nails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the cheese,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll
have this thing fixed up in jig time. Hasn&rsquo;t Sid
Henderson showed up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I guess he&rsquo;s over to the new room. He
took his books and left some time ago. Maybe
he&rsquo;s studying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. &ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d
come and help move. Some of this stuff is his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of it is. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re going to help,
or I&rsquo;d never have the courage to shift. Well, let&rsquo;s
get the sofa fixed. I doubt if we can make it hold
together, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we can. I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil went to work in earnest. He was an
athletic-looking chap, of generous size, and one of
the best runners at Randall College. He was one
of Tom Parson&rsquo;s particular chums, the other being
Sidney Henderson. Tom and Sid, of whom more
will be told presently, had roomed together during
their freshman year at Randall, and Phil&rsquo;s apartment
was not far away. Toward the close of the
term the three boys were much together, Phil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
spending more time in the room of Tom and Sid
than he did in his own. In this way he became
very much attached to the old chair and sofa, which
formed two of the choicest possessions of the
lads.</p>

<p>With the opening of the new term, when the
freshmen had become more or less dignified sophomores,
Phil had proposed that he and his two
chums shift to a large room in the west dormitory,
where the majority of the sophomores and
juniors lived. His plan was enthusiastically
adopted by Sid and Tom, and, as soon as they had
arrived at college, ready for the beginning of the
term, moving day had been instituted. But Sid,
after helping Tom get their possessions in a pile
in the middle of the room they were about to
leave, had disappeared, and Phil, enthusiastic about
getting his two best friends into an apartment with
him, had come over to aid Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you see,&rdquo; went on Phil, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll nail this
board along the front edge of the sofa&mdash;so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think, old chap&mdash;and I know
you&rsquo;ll excuse my mentioning it,&rdquo; said Tom&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you think that it rather spoils, well, we&rsquo;ll say the
artistic beauty of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Artistic fiddlesticks!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. &ldquo;Of
course it does! But it&rsquo;s the only way to hold it
together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One could, I suppose, put a sort of drapery&mdash;flounce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
I believe, is the proper word&mdash;over it,&rdquo;
went on Tom. &ldquo;That would hide the unsightly
board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether it&rsquo;s hid or not!&rdquo; exclaimed
Phil. &ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t get down here
and help hold this end, while I nail the other, I
know what&rsquo;s going to happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Tom, as he carefully put in his
pocket the photograph of the pretty girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have a mob of howling freshmen
in here, and there won&rsquo;t be any sofa left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perish the thought!&rdquo; cried Tom, and then he
set to work in earnest helping Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now a board on the back,&rdquo; said the amateur
carpenter, and for a few minutes he hammered
vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a regular anvil chorus,&rdquo; remarked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, no knocking!&rdquo; exclaimed his chum.
&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s see if it&rsquo;s stiff enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anxiously he raised one end of the sofa. There
was no sagging in the middle this time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like putting a new keel on a ship!&rdquo; cried
the inventor of the scheme gaily. &ldquo;A few more
nails, and it will do. Do you think the chair will
stand shifting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. That&rsquo;s like the &lsquo;one-horse shay&rsquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;ll
hold together until it flies apart by spontaneous
combustion. You needn&rsquo;t worry about that.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Phil proceeded to drive a few more nails in the
boards he had attached to the front and back of
the sofa. Then he got up to admire his work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call that pretty good, Tom; don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>The two chums drew back to the farther side
of the room to get the effect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess with a ruffle or two, a little insertion,
and a bit of old lace, it will hide the fractured
places, Phil. It&rsquo;s a pity&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, what are you scoundrels doing to my
old sofa?&rdquo; exclaimed a voice. &ldquo;Vandals! How
dare you spoil that antique?&rdquo; and another lad entered
the room. &ldquo;Say, why didn&rsquo;t you put new legs
on it, insert new springs, and cover it over while
you were about it?&rdquo; he asked sarcastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, you old fossil, we <i>had</i> to put those
boards on,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Where have you been,
Sid? Phil and I were getting ready to move without
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve been cleaning out the new room we&rsquo;re
going into. The juniors who were there last term
must have tried to raise vegetables in it, judging
by the amount of dirt I found. But it&rsquo;s all right
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Now if you&rsquo;ll catch hold here, we&rsquo;ll
move the old sofa first. The rest will be easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid Henderson grasped the head of the couch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
while Tom took the foot. Phil acted as general
manager, and steadied it on the side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy now, easy boys,&rdquo; he cautioned, as they
moved toward the door leading to the hall.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<h3>LANGRIDGE HAS A TUMBLE</h3>


<p>Out into the corridor went the three lads with
the old sofa. It was no easy task, but they managed
to get it out of the east dormitory, where they
had roomed for a year, and then they began the
journey across a stretch of grass to the west building.</p>

<p>The appearance of the three boys, carrying a
dilapidated sofa, as tenderly as though it were
some rare and fragile object, attracted the attention
of a crowd of students. The lads swarmed
over to surround the movers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, would you look at that!&rdquo; exclaimed Holman,
otherwise known as &ldquo;Holly,&rdquo; Cross. &ldquo;Have
you had a fire, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; they&rsquo;ve been to an auction sale of antiques,
and this is the bed on which Louis XIV slept the
night before he ate the Welsh rarebit,&rdquo; declared
Ed Kerr, the champion catcher on the &rsquo;varsity nine.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you label it, Phil, so a fellow would
know what it is?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You get out of the way!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom good-naturedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This side up, with care. Store in a cool, dry
place, and water frequently,&rdquo; quoted Billy Housenlager,
who rejoiced in the title of Dutch. &ldquo;Here,
let me see if I can jump over it while it is in
motion,&rdquo; he added, for he was full of &ldquo;horseplay,&rdquo;
and always anxious to try something new. He took
a running start, and was about to leap full upon
the sofa, when, at a signal from Phil, the three
chums set the spliced piece of furniture on the
grass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Dutch indignantly.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give a fellow a chance to practice jumping?
I can beat Grasshopper Backus, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can not!&rdquo; exclaimed the owner of the title.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure to make the track team this term, and
then you&rsquo;ll see what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; put in another student, &ldquo;my uncle says
that when he was here he used to jump&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drown him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuff grass in his mouth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make him eat the horsehair in the sofa!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swallow it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chew it up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were some of the cries of derision that
greeted Ford Fenton&rsquo;s mention of his uncle. The
gentleman had once been a coach at Randall, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a very good one, too, but his nephew was doing
much to spoil his reputation.</p>

<p>For, at every chance he got, and at times when
there was no opportunity but such as he made,
Ford would quote his aforesaid uncle, upon any
and all subjects, to the no small disapproval of
his college mates. So they had gotten into the
habit of &ldquo;rigging&rdquo; him every time he mentioned
his relative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Ford said, when the chorus of
exclamations had ceased. &ldquo;My uncle&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he got no further, for the students made a
rush for him and buried him out of sight in a
pile of wriggling arms and legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First down; ten yards to gain!&rdquo; yelled some
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, now&rsquo;s our chance,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;First
thing we know they&rsquo;ll do that to our sofa, and
then it will be all up with the poor old thing. Let&rsquo;s
move on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more the chums took up their burden, and
walked toward the west dormitory. By this time
the throng had done with punishing poor Fenton,
and once more turned its attention to the movers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to split it up for firewood?&rdquo; called Ed
Kerr.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s full of germs, and they&rsquo;re going to
dig &rsquo;em out and use &rsquo;em in the biology class,&rdquo; suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Dan Woodhouse, who was more commonly
called Kindlings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re going to make a folding bed of
it,&rdquo; came from Bricktop Molloy. &ldquo;Come on, fellows,
let&rsquo;s investigate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowd of fun-loving students hurried after
the three lads carrying the sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drop the sofa and cut for it?&rdquo; proposed
Sid. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll make a rough house if they catch
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to desert the sofa!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I. I&rsquo;ll stick by you&mdash;&lsquo;I will stand at thy
right hand, and guard the bridge with thee,&rsquo;&rdquo;
quoted Phil. &ldquo;But if we put a little more speed
on we can get to the dormitory, and that will be
sanctuary, I guess. Come on; run, fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was awkward work, running and carrying a
clumsy sofa, but they managed it. Holly Cross
caught up to them as they were at the door of the
building.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, let&rsquo;s have the old ark,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
make a bonfire of it, and circle about it to-night,
after we haze some freshies. Give us the old
relic, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not on your life!&rdquo; exclaimed the crack pitcher
of the &rsquo;varsity nine. &ldquo;This is our choicest possession,
Holly. It goes wherever we go.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it won&rsquo;t go much longer,&rdquo; observed
Holly. &ldquo;One of its legs is coming off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Almost as he spoke one of the sofa legs, probably
jarred loose by the unaccustomed rapid rate
of progress, fell to the dormitory steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! Oh, dear!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
beginning to fall apart, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, you can nail it on. Sid, you carry
the leg. The stairs are so narrow that only two
of us can manage the sofa. Phil and I will do
that, and you come in back to catch me, in case I
fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seeing that there was no chance to get the sofa
away from its owners, to make a college holiday
with it, Holly Cross and his friends turned back
to look for another source of sport. Sid picked
up the leg, and then, with Phil mounting the stairs
backward, carrying one end, and Tom advancing
and holding the other, the task was begun. Up
the stairs they went, and when they were half way
there appeared at the head of the flight two lads.
They were both well dressed in expensive clothes,
and there was about them that indefinable air of
&ldquo;sportiness&rdquo; which is so easily recognizable but
hard to acquire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked the foremost of the
two, as he looked down on the approaching cavalcade
and the sofa. &ldquo;Here, what do you fellows
mean by blocking up the stairway? Don&rsquo;t you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
know that no tradesmen are allowed in this entrance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you talking to?&rdquo; demanded Phil, not
seeing who was speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Langridge,&rdquo; explained Tom, as he looked
up and saw his former enemy and rival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Parsons, Henderson and Clinton,&rdquo;
went on Fred Langridge, as he recognized some
fellow students. Then, without apologizing for
his former words, he went on: &ldquo;I say, you fellows
will have to back down and let me and Gerhart
past. We are in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So are we,&rdquo; said Tom shortly. &ldquo;I guess you
can wait until we come up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Langridge. &ldquo;You
back up! You have no right to block up the stairs
this way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we have,&rdquo; put in Sid. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
moving some of our things to our new room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Langridge, followed by the other well-dressed
lad, came down a few steps. He saw the old sofa,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Do you mean to say that you fellows
are moving that fuzzy-wuzzy piece of architecture
into this dormitory? I&rsquo;ll not stand for it! I&rsquo;ll
complain to the proctor! Why, it&rsquo;s full of disease
germs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you&rsquo;re full of prune juice!&rdquo; cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Phil Clinton, unable to stand the arrogant words
and manner of Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get gay with me!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom&rsquo;s
former rival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay you five to three that you can&rsquo;t jump
over their heads and clear the sofa,&rdquo; put in the
other student, whom Langridge had called Gerhart.
&ldquo;Do any of you fellows want to bet?&rdquo; he
asked rather sneeringly, as he looked down at Tom,
Phil and Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; answered Tom, good-naturedly
enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re not sports, I see,&rdquo; rejoined Gerhart.
&ldquo;I thought you said this was a sporty college, Langridge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is, when you strike the right crowd, and
not a lot of greasy digs,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I say,
are you chaps going to move back and let me
and Gerhart pass?&rdquo; he went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; replied Phil shortly. &ldquo;You
can wait until we get up. Go on back now, Langridge,
and we&rsquo;ll soon have this out of the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burning it up would be the best method of
getting it out of the way,&rdquo; declared Langridge, still
with that sneer in his voice. &ldquo;I never saw such
a disgraceful piece of furniture. What do you
fellows want with it? Surely you&rsquo;re not going to
put it in your room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what we are going to do,&rdquo; declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Sid. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t part with this for a
good bit, would we, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; chorused Phil and Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did it come over in the <i>Mayflower</i>?&rdquo; asked
Gerhart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to bet ten to one that if
you think it&rsquo;s an antique that you&rsquo;re stuck. How
about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite a sport, aren&rsquo;t you, freshie?&rdquo;
asked Phil suddenly, for he knew that the new
student must belong to the first-year class.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m a sport, but if you go to calling
names I&rsquo;ll show you that I&rsquo;m something else!&rdquo; exclaimed
the other fiercely. &ldquo;If you want to do a
little something in the boxing line&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dry up!&rdquo; hastily advised Langridge in a whisper.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a freshman, and you know it.
They&rsquo;re sophomores, and so am I. Don&rsquo;t get gay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they needn&rsquo;t insult a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us when one&rsquo;s around, and we&rsquo;ll be on our
good behavior,&rdquo; spoke Phil with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, now, are you fellows going to back down
and let us pass?&rdquo; asked Langridge hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like the old guard, we die, but never surrender,&rdquo;
spoke Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to back down,
Langridge. It&rsquo;s easier for you to go back than
for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going to do it. You have no
right to move your stuff in here, anyhow. The
rooms are furnished.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We want our old chair and sofa,&rdquo; explained
Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you&rsquo;d be ashamed to bring such
truck into a decent college,&rdquo; expostulated Langridge.
&ldquo;It looks as if it had been through a fire
in a second-hand store.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do you,&rdquo; remarked Phil. &ldquo;This is our
sofa, and we&rsquo;ll do as we please with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t block up my way, that&rsquo;s one thing
you won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; declared Langridge fiercely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going down. Look out! If I upset you fellows
it won&rsquo;t be my fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started down the stairs, and managed to
squeeze past Phil, who, though he did not like
Langridge, moved as far to one side as possible
in the narrow passage. As Langridge passed the
sofa he struck it with a little cane he carried. A
cloud of dust arose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; exclaimed the sporty lad. &ldquo;Smell
the germs! Wow! Get me some disinfectant,
Gerhart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether it was the action of Langridge in hitting
the sofa that caused Tom to stagger, or
whether Phil was unsteady on his feet and pushed
on the sofa, did not develop. At any rate, just as
Langridge came opposite to Tom on the stairs, the
former pitcher was jostled against his rival. Langridge
stumbled, tried to save himself by clutching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
at Tom and then at the sofa. He missed both,
and, with a loud exclamation, plunged down head
first, bringing up with a resounding thud at the
bottom.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<h3>PHIL GETS BAD NEWS</h3>


<p>For a moment after he struck the bottom of
the stairs, Fred Langridge remained stretched out,
making no move. Tom Parsons feared his former
rival was badly hurt, and was about to call to Sid
to go and investigate, when Langridge got up.
His face showed the rage he felt, though it was
characteristic of him that he first brushed the dust
off his clothes. He was nothing if not neat about
his person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do that for?&rdquo; he cried to Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shove me down like that. I might have broken
my neck. As it is, I&rsquo;ve wrenched my ankle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d stayed
up where you were, until we got past with the sofa,
it wouldn&rsquo;t have happened. You shouldn&rsquo;t have
tried to pass us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t, eh? Well, I guess I&rsquo;ve got as
good a right on these stairs as you fellows have,
with your musty old furniture. You oughtn&rsquo;t
be allowed to have it. You deliberately pushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
me down, Tom Parsons, and I&rsquo;ll fix you for it!&rdquo;
and Langridge limped about, exaggerating the hurt
to his ankle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t push you!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom. &ldquo;It was
an accident that you jostled against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t jostle against you. You deliberately
leaned against me to save yourself from falling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not! And if you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You brought it on yourself, Langridge,&rdquo; interrupted
Phil. &ldquo;You got fresh and hit the sofa,
and that made you lose your balance. It&rsquo;s your
own fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mind your business! When I want you
to speak I&rsquo;ll address my remarks to you. I&rsquo;m talking
to Parsons now, and I tell him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t take the trouble to tell me anything,&rdquo;
declared Tom. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear
you. I&rsquo;ve told you it was an accident, and if
you insist that it was done purposely I have only
to say that you are intimating that I am not telling
the truth. In that case there can be but one
thing to do, and I&rsquo;ll do it as soon as I&rsquo;ve gotten
this sofa into our room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an obvious meaning in Tom&rsquo;s words,
and Langridge had no trouble in fathoming it.
He did not care to come to a personal encounter
with Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you fellows hadn&rsquo;t been moving that
measly old sofa in, this would never have happened,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
growled Langridge as he limped away.
&ldquo;Come on, Gerhart. We&rsquo;ll find more congenial
company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll wait until they get the sofa out of
the way,&rdquo; remarked the new chum Langridge appeared
to have picked up.</p>

<p>Tom, Sid and Phil resumed their journey, and
the old piece of furniture was carried to the upper
hall. The stairs were clear, and Gerhart descended.
As he passed Tom he looked at him with
something of a sneer on his face, and remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay you even money that Langridge can
whip you in a fair fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you little freshie,&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, &ldquo;fair
fights are the only kind we have at Randall! We
don&rsquo;t have &rsquo;em very often, but every time we do
Tom puts the kibosh all over your friend Langridge.
Another thing&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t healthy for freshies
to bet too much. They might go broke,&rdquo; and with
these words of advice Phil caught up his end of
the sofa and Tom the other. It was soon in the
room the three sophomore chums had selected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for the chair and the rest of the truck,&rdquo;
called Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s rest a bit,&rdquo; suggested Sid, as he
stretched out on the sofa. No sooner had he
reached a reclining position than he sat up suddenly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What in the name of the
labors of Hercules is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew from the back of his coat a long nail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I must have left it on the sofa when I
fixed it,&rdquo; said Phil innocently. &ldquo;I wondered what
had become of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t wonder any longer,&rdquo; spoke Sid
ruefully. &ldquo;Tom, take a look, that&rsquo;s a good chap,
and see if there&rsquo;s a very big hole in my back. I
think my lungs are punctured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it, from the way you let out that
yell,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;That will teach you not to take
a siesta during moving operations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much damage done,&rdquo; Tom reported with
a laugh, as he inspected his chum&rsquo;s coat. &ldquo;Come
on now, let&rsquo;s get the rest of it done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think it will be safe to leave the sofa
here?&rdquo; asked Sid. &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;d better stay and
keep guard over it, while you fellows fetch the
rest of the things in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, listen to him!&rdquo; burst out Phil. &ldquo;What
harm will come to it here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Langridge and that sporty new chum of
his may slip in and damage it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, if they can damage this sofa any more than
it is now, I&rsquo;d like to see them,&rdquo; spoke Tom. &ldquo;I
defy even the fingers of Father Time himself to
work further havoc. No, most noble Anthony, the
sofa will be perfectly safe here.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say as much for you, if Langridge
gets a chance at you,&rdquo; said Phil to Tom. &ldquo;You
know what tricks he played on you last term.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but I guess he&rsquo;s had his lesson,&rdquo; remarked
Tom. &ldquo;Now come on, and we&rsquo;ll finish up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three lads went back to the room formerly
occupied by Sid and Tom during their freshman
year. The chums were pretty much of a size, and
they made an interesting picture as they strolled
across the campus.</p>

<p>Tom Parsons had come to Randall College the
term previous, from the town of Northville, where
his parents lived. He did not care to follow his
father&rsquo;s occupation of farming, and so had decided
on a college education, using part of his own money
to pay his way.</p>

<p>As told in the first volume of this series, entitled
&ldquo;The Rival Pitchers,&rdquo; Tom had no sooner reached
Randall than he incurred the enmity of Fred Langridge,
a rich youth from Chicago, who was manager
of the &rsquo;varsity ball nine, and also its pitcher.
Tom had ambitions to fill that position himself,
and as soon as Langridge learned this, he was
more than ever the enemy of the country lad.</p>

<p>Randall College was located near the town of
Haddonfield, in one of our middle Western States,
and was on the shore of Sunny River, not far from
Lake Tonoka. Within a comparatively short distance
from Randall were two other institutions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
learning. One was Boxer Hall, and the other
Fairview Institute, a co-educational academy.
These three colleges had formed the Tonoka Lake
League in athletics, and the rivalry on the gridiron
and diamond, as well as in milder forms of sport&mdash;rowing,
tennis, basketball and hockey&mdash;ran high.
When Tom arrived there was much talk of baseball,
and Randall had a good nine in prospect.
Her hopes ran toward winning the Lake League
pennant in baseball, but as her nine had been at
the bottom of the list for several seasons, the
chances were dubious.</p>

<p>After many hardships, not a few of which Langridge
was responsible for, Tom got a chance to
play on the &rsquo;varsity nine. Langridge was a good
pitcher, but he secretly drank and smoked, to say
nothing of staying up late nights to gamble; and so
he was not in good form. When it came to the
crucial moment he could not &ldquo;make good,&rdquo; and
Tom was put in his place, in the pitching box, and
by phenomenal work won the deciding game. This
made Randall champion of the baseball league, and
Tom Parsons was hailed as a hero, Langridge being
supplanted as pitcher and manager.</p>

<p>But if Langridge and some of the latter&rsquo;s set
were his enemies, Tom had many friends, not the
least among whom were Phil Clinton and Sidney
Henderson, to say nothing of Miss Madge Tyler.
This young lady and Langridge were, at first, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
good friends, but when Madge found out what
sort of a chap the rich city youth was, she broke
friendship with him, and Tom had the pleasure
of taking her to more than one college affair.
This, of course, did not add to the good feeling
between Tom and Langridge.</p>

<p>With the winning of the championship game,
baseball came practically to an end at Randall, as
well as at the other colleges in the Tonoka Lake
League, and a sort of truce was patched up between
Tom and Langridge. The summer vacation soon
came, and the students scattered to their homes.
Tom and his two chums agreed to room together
during the term which opens with this story, and
it may be mentioned incidentally that both Tom
and Phil hoped to play on the football eleven. Phil
was practically assured of a place, for he had played
the game at a preparatory school, and had as good
a reputation in regard to filling the position of
quarter-back as Tom had in the pitching box.</p>

<p>It was due to a great catch which Phil made in
the deciding championship game, almost as much
as to Tom&rsquo;s wonderful pitching, that Randall had
the banner, and Captain Holly Cross, of the eleven,
had marked Phil for one of his men during the
season which was about to open on the gridiron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll take the old armchair over,&rdquo; proposed
Tom, when he and his chums had reached
the room they were vacating. &ldquo;I guess I can manage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that alone. You fellows carry some of the
other paraphernalia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil and Sid prepared to load themselves down
with gloves, balls, bats, foils and various articles
of sport. Before he left with the chair, Tom observed
Sid looking behind the door as if for something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not there, old man. I took it down,&rdquo; said
the pitcher, and he patted the pocket that held
Madge Tyler&rsquo;s photograph. &ldquo;You thought you&rsquo;d
make me forget it, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say you&rsquo;re going to stick girls&rsquo;
pictures up in our new room?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not girls&rsquo; pictures, in general,&rdquo; replied Tom,
&ldquo;but one in particular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make me tired!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid, who cared
little for feminine society.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t look at it if you don&rsquo;t like,&rdquo; responded
his chum. &ldquo;But I call her a pretty girl,
don&rsquo;t you, Phil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s an all right looker,&rdquo; answered the other
with such enthusiasm that Tom glanced at him a
trifle sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s no prettier than Phil&rsquo;s sister,&rdquo; declared
Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you a sister?&rdquo; demanded Tom.</p>

<p>Phil bowed in assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say so before?&rdquo; asked Tom
grumblingly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you never asked me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to Fairview this term, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So is Madge&mdash;I mean Miss Tyler,&rdquo; burst out
Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to meet her, Phil; your sister, I
mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;re a regular Mormon!&rdquo; expostulated
Sid. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going to get this moving done,
let&rsquo;s do it, and not talk about girls. You fellows
make me sick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until he gets bitten by the bug,&rdquo; said Tom
with a laugh, as he shouldered the easy chair.</p>

<p>It took the lads several trips to transfer all their
possessions, but at last it was accomplished, and
they sat in the new room in the midst of &ldquo;confusion
worse confounded,&rdquo; as Holly Cross remarked
when he looked in on them. Their goods were
scattered all over, and the three beds in the room
were piled high with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a much nicer place than the old room,&rdquo; declared
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be when we get it fixed up,&rdquo; added
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose that means sticking a lot of girls&rsquo; photos
on the wall, some of those crazy banners they embroidered
for you, a lot of ribbons, and such truck,&rdquo;
commented Sid disgustedly. &ldquo;I tell you fellows
one thing, though, and that is if you go to cluttering
up this room too much, I&rsquo;ll have something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to say. I&rsquo;m not going to live in a cozy corner, nor
yet a den. I want a decent room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can have one wall space to decorate in
any style you like,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; he&rsquo;ll probably adopt the early English or
the late French style,&rdquo; declared Phil, &ldquo;and have
nothing but a calendar on it. Well, every one to
his notion. Hello, the alarm clock has stopped,&rdquo;
and he began to shake it vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy with it!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Do you want to
jar the insides loose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hurt this clock,&rdquo; declared Phil, and,
as if to prove his words, the fussy little timepiece
began ticking away again, as loudly and insistingly
as ever. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get the room into some decent
kind of shape, and then I&rsquo;m going out and see
what the prospects are for football,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;I want to make that quarter-back position if I
have to train nights and early mornings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get it, all right,&rdquo; declared Tom. &ldquo;I
wish I was as sure of a place as you are. I believe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a knock at the door. Sid
opened it. In the hall stood one of the college
messengers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Wallops; what have you there?&rdquo; asked
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Telegram for Mr. Phil Clinton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hand it over,&rdquo; spoke Sid, taking the envelope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
from the youth. &ldquo;Probably it&rsquo;s a proposition for
him to manage one of the big college football
teams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Wallops, who, like nearly everything and
every one else about the college had a nickname,
departed down the corridor, Phil opened the missive.
It was brief, but his face paled as he read it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad news?&rdquo; asked Tom quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother is quite ill, and they will have to
operate on her to save her life,&rdquo; said Phil slowly.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<h3>FOOTBALL PRACTICE</h3>


<p>There was a moment of silence in the room.
No one cared to speak, for, though Tom and Sid
felt their hearts filled with sympathy for Phil,
they did not know what to say. It was curiously
quiet&mdash;oppressively so. The fussy little alarm
clock, on the table piled high with books, was ticking
away, as if eager to call attention to itself.
Indeed, it did succeed in a measure, for Tom remarked
gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me that sounds louder than it did in
the other room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are more echoes here,&rdquo; spoke Sid, also
quietly. &ldquo;It will be different when we get the
things up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spell had been broken. Each one breathed
a sigh of relief. Phil, whose face had become
strangely white, stared down at the telegram in his
hand. The paper rustled loudly&mdash;almost as loudly
as the clock ticked. Tom spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it&mdash;is it something sudden?&rdquo; he asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
&ldquo;Was she all right when you left home to come
back to college?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly all right,&rdquo; answered Phil, and he
seemed to be carefully picking his words, so slowly
did he speak. &ldquo;She had been in poor health for
some time, and we thought a change of air would
do her good. So father took her to Florida&mdash;a
place near Palm Beach. I came on here, and I
hoped to hear good news. Now&mdash;now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
could not proceed, and turned away.</p>

<p>Tom coughed unnecessarily loud, and Sid seemed
to have suddenly developed a most tremendous
cold. He had to go to the window to look out,
probably to see if it was getting colder. In doing
so he knocked from a chair a football, which
bounded erratically about the room, as the spherical
pigskin always does bounce. The movements of
it attracted the attention of all, and mercifully came
as a relief to their overwrought nerves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sid, as he blew his nose with seemingly
needless violence, &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll have to
give up football now; for you&rsquo;ll go to Florida.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Phil simply, &ldquo;of course I shall go.
I think I&rsquo;ll wire dad first, though, and tell him I&rsquo;m
going to start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the message to the telegraph office for
you,&rdquo; offered Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, let me go,&rdquo; begged Sid. &ldquo;I can run faster
than you, Tom.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice thing to say, especially when I&rsquo;m
going to try for end on the &rsquo;varsity eleven,&rdquo; said
Tom a bit reproachfully. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Holly Cross
or Coach Lighton hear you say that, or I&rsquo;ll be
down and out. I&rsquo;m none too good in my running,
I know, but I&rsquo;m going to practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess you&rsquo;ll make out all right,&rdquo; commented
Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you fellows.
I guess I can take the message myself, though,&rdquo;
and he sat down at the littered table, pushing the
things aside, to write the dispatch.</p>

<p>Tom and Sid said little when Phil went out to
take the telegram to the office. The two chums,
one on the old patched sofa and the other in the
creaking chair, which at every movement sent up
a cloud of dust from the ancient cushion, maintained
a solemn silence. Tom did remark once:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tough luck, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which Sid made reply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, then, to be understood, you don&rsquo;t need to
talk much under such circumstances. In a little
while footsteps were heard along the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here he comes!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, and he arose
from the sofa with such haste that the new boards,
which Phil had put on to strengthen it, seemed
likely to snap off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go easy on that, will you?&rdquo; begged Sid. &ldquo;Do
you want to break it?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Tom meekly, and he fell to
arranging his books, a task which Sid supplemented
by piling the sporting goods indiscriminately in a
corner. They wanted to be busy when Phil came
in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew! You fellows are raising a terrible
dust!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. He seemed more at his
ease now. In grief there is nothing so diverting
as action, and now that he had sent his telegram,
and hoped to be able to see his mother shortly, it
made the bad news a little easier to bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; spoke Tom; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Sid. He raises a dust
every time he gets into or out of that chair. I
really think we ought to send it to the upholsterer&rsquo;s
and have it renovated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;d be nothing left of it,&rdquo; declared Phil.
&ldquo;Better let well enough alone. It&rsquo;ll last for some
years yet&mdash;as long as we are in Randall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you send the message?&rdquo; blurted out Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and now I&rsquo;ll wait for an answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it&mdash;will they have to&mdash;I mean&mdash;of course
there&rsquo;s some danger in an operation,&rdquo; stammered
Sid, blushing like a girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Phil gravely. &ldquo;It is very dangerous.
I don&rsquo;t exactly know what it is, but before
she went away our family doctor said that if it
came to an operation it would be a serious one.
Now&mdash;now it seems that it&rsquo;s time for it. Dear old
mother&mdash;I&mdash;I hope&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He was struggling with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
himself. &ldquo;Oh, hang it all!&rdquo; he suddenly burst out.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get this room to rights. If&mdash;if I go away
I&rsquo;ll have the nightmare thinking what shape it&rsquo;s
in. Let&rsquo;s fix up a bit, and then go out and take
a walk. Then it will be grub time. After that
we&rsquo;ll go out and see if any more fellows have
arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was good advice&mdash;just the thing needed to
take their attention off Phil&rsquo;s grief, and they fell
to work with a will. In a short time the room
began to look something like those they had left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, what are you sticking up over there?&rdquo;
called Sid to Tom, as he detected the latter in the
act of tacking something on the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m putting up a photograph,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A girl&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ll bet you a new hat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom simply. &ldquo;Why, you old anchorite,
haven&rsquo;t I a right to? It&rsquo;s a pity you wouldn&rsquo;t
get a girl yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! I&rsquo;d like to see myself,&rdquo; murmured
Sid, as he carefully tacked up a calendar and a
couple of football pictures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s Miss Tyler&rsquo;s picture, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; spoke
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil was sorting his books when from a volume
of Pliny there dropped a photograph. Tom spied
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It seems that I&rsquo;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
not the only one to have girls&rsquo; pictures. Say, but
she&rsquo;s a good-looker, all right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my sister Ruth,&rdquo; said Phil quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon,&rdquo; came quickly from
Tom. &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; spoke Phil genially. &ldquo;I believe
she is considered quite pretty. I was going
to put her picture up on the wall, but since Sid
objects to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried the amateur misogynist.
&ldquo;Say, you can put that picture up on my side of
the room if you like, Phil. I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t object to&mdash;to
all girls&rsquo; pictures; it&rsquo;s only&mdash;well&mdash;er&mdash;she&rsquo;s
your sister&mdash;put her picture where you like,&rdquo; and
he fairly glared at Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonders will never cease,&rdquo; quoted the &rsquo;varsity
pitcher. &ldquo;Your sister has worked a miracle, Phil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dry up!&rdquo; commanded Sid. &ldquo;All I ask is,
don&rsquo;t make the room a photograph gallery.
There&rsquo;s reason in all things. Go ahead, Phil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next thing he&rsquo;ll be wanting will be to have
an introduction to your sister,&rdquo; commented Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have both you fellows meet her,&rdquo;
said Phil gravely. &ldquo;You probably would have,
only for this&mdash;this trouble of mother&rsquo;s. Now I
suppose sis will have to leave Fairview and go to
Palm Beach with me. I must take a run over this
evening, and see her. She&rsquo;ll be all broken up.&rdquo;
It was not much of a journey to Fairview, a railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was well as a trolley line connecting the town
of that name with Haddonfield.</p>

<p>The room was soon fitted up in fairly good
shape, though the three chums promised that they
would make a number of changes in time. They
went to dinner together, meeting at the table many
of their former classmates, and seeing an unusually
large number of freshmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be plenty of hazing this term,&rdquo; commented
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess we&rsquo;ll have our hands full,&rdquo; added
Sid.</p>

<p>Old and new students continued to arrive all
that day. After reporting to the proper officials
of the college there was nothing for them to do,
save to stroll about, as lectures would not begin
until the next morning, and then only preliminary
classes would be formed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go down to the office and see if any
telegram has arrived for me,&rdquo; said Phil, as he
and his chums were strolling across the campus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you get good news,&rdquo; spoke Tom.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait for you in the room, and help you
pack if you have to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; was Phil&rsquo;s answer as he walked
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Tom, I suppose you&rsquo;re going to be with
us this fall?&rdquo; asked Holly Cross, captain of the
football eleven, as he spied Tom and Sid.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am if I can make it. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got plenty of good material for
ends, and of course we want the best, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I understand,&rdquo; said Tom with a laugh.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking any favors. I had my honors this
spring on the diamond. But I&rsquo;m going to try, just
the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you make it,&rdquo; said Holly fervently.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have some try-out practice the last of this
week. Where&rsquo;s Phil? I&rsquo;ve about decided on him
for quarter-back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he can play,&rdquo; remarked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not play!&rdquo; cried Holly.</p>

<p>Then they told him, and the captain was quite
broken up over the news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;all we can hope is that
his mother gets better in time for him to get into
the game with us. We want to do the same thing
to Boxer Hall and Fairview at football as we did
in baseball. I do hope Phil can play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do we,&rdquo; came from Tom, as he and Sid
continued on to their room.</p>

<p>It was half an hour before Phil came in, and the
time seemed three times as long to the two chums
in their new apartment. When he entered the
room both gazed apprehensively at him. There
was a different look on Phil&rsquo;s face than there had
been.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Tom, and his voice seemed very
loud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dad doesn&rsquo;t want me to come,&rdquo; was Phil&rsquo;s answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not come&mdash;why? Is it too&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ve decided to postpone the operation,&rdquo;
went on Phil. &ldquo;It seems that she&rsquo;s a little
better, and there may be a chance. Anyhow, dad
thinks if sis and I came down it would only worry
mother, and make her think she was getting worse,
and that would be bad. So I&rsquo;ll not go to Florida.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s good news?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, much better than I dared to hope. Maybe
she&rsquo;ll get well without an operation. I feel fine,
now. I&rsquo;m going over to Fairview and tell my sister.
Dad asked me to let her know. I feel ten
years younger, fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do we!&rdquo; cried Tom, and he seized his chum&rsquo;s
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out and haze a couple of dozen freshmen,&rdquo;
proposed Sid eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bloodthirsty old rascal!&rdquo; commented Phil.
&ldquo;Let the poor freshies alone. They&rsquo;ll get all that&rsquo;s
coming to them, all right. Well, I&rsquo;m off. Hold
down the room, you two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom and Sid spent the evening in their apartment,
after Phil had received permission to go to
Fairview, Tom having entrusted him with a message
to Madge Tyler. The two chums had a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of invitations to assist in hazing freshmen, but
declined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to do it without Phil,&rdquo; said
Tom, and this loyal view was shared by Sid.</p>

<p>Phil came back late that night, or, rather, early
the next morning, for it was past midnight when
he got to Randall College.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friend Madge sends word that she hopes
you&rsquo;ll take her to the opening game of the football
season,&rdquo; said Phil to Tom, as he was undressing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see her?&rdquo; inquired Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. Ruth sent for her. She&rsquo;s all you
said she was, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; spoke Tom in a curious voice, and then
he was strangely silent. For Phil was a good-looking
chap, and had plenty of money; and Tom
remembered what friends Madge and Langridge
had been. His sleep was not an untroubled one
that night.</p>

<p>Two or three days more of general excitement
ensued before matters were running smoothly at
Randall. In that time most of the students had
settled in their new rooms, the freshmen found
their places, some were properly hazed, and that
ordeal for others was postponed until a future date,
much to the misery of the fledglings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Preliminary football practice to-morrow,&rdquo; announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Phil one afternoon, as he came in from
the gymnasium and found Tom and Sid studying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Are you going to
try, Sid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not this year. I&rsquo;ve got to buckle down to
studies, I guess. Baseball is about all I can stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear Langridge is out of it, too,&rdquo; said Phil.
&ldquo;His uncle has put a ban on it. He&rsquo;s got to make
good in lessons this term.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think the team will be better off without
him,&rdquo; commented Sid. &ldquo;Not that he&rsquo;s a poor
player, but he won&rsquo;t train properly, and that has
a bad effect on the other fellows. It&rsquo;s not fair
to them, either. Look what he did in baseball.
We&rsquo;d have lost the championship if it hadn&rsquo;t been
for Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; modestly spoke
the hero of the pitching box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, turn out in football togs to-morrow,&rdquo;
went on Phil. &ldquo;By the way, I hear that Langridge&rsquo;s
new freshman friend&mdash;Gerhart&mdash;is going
to try for quarter-back against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! that fellow who was with him when
we were moving our sofa in?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! Doesn&rsquo;t look as if he was heavy
enough for football,&rdquo; commented Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell by the looks of a toad how much
hay it can eat,&rdquo; quoted Phil.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The following afternoon a crowd of sturdy lads,
in their football suits, thronged out on the gridiron,
which was the baseball field properly put in
shape. The goal posts had been erected, and
Coach Lighton and Captain Cross were on hand
to greet the candidates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows,&rdquo; said the coach, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll just have
a little running, tackling, passing the ball, some
simple formations and other exercises to test your
wind and legs. I&rsquo;ll pick out four teams, and
you can play against each other.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<h3>A CLASH</h3>


<p>Ragged work, necessarily, marked the opening
of the practice. The ball was dropped, fumbled,
fallen upon, lost, regained, tossed and kicked. But
it all served a purpose, and the coach and captain,
with keen eyes, watched the different candidates.
Now and then they gave a word of advice, cautioning
some player about wrong movements, or
suggesting a different method.</p>

<p>Phil had been put in as quarter-back on one
scrub team, and Tom, as left-end, on the same.
Phil found his opponent on the opposing eleven to
be none other than Langridge&rsquo;s friend, Gerhart.
It did not need much of an eye to see that Gerhart
did not know the game. He would have done well
enough on a small eleven, but he had neither the
ability nor the strength to last through a college
contest.</p>

<p>Several times, when it was his rival&rsquo;s turn to
pass back the ball, Phil saw the inefficient work of
Gerhart, but he said nothing. He felt that he was
sure of his place on the &rsquo;varsity eleven, yet he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
called to mind how Langridge had used his influence
to keep Tom Parsons from pitching in the
spring.</p>

<p>There was no denying that Langridge had influence
with the sporting crowd, and it was possible
that he might exert it in favor of his new chum
and against Phil. But there was one comfort:
Langridge was not as prominent in sports as he
had been during the spring term, when he was
manager of the baseball team. He had lost that
position because of his failure to train and play
properly, and, too, his uncle, who was his guardian,
had insisted that he pay more attention to
studies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, I don&rsquo;t believe I have much to fear
from him,&rdquo; thought Phil. Then came a scrimmage,
and he threw himself into the mass play to
prevent the opposing eleven from gaining.</p>

<p>The practice lasted half an hour, and at the
close Coach Lighton and Captain Cross walked
off the field, talking earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew what they were saying,&rdquo; spoke
Phil, as he and Tom strolled toward the dressing-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;re the best ever, Phil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! They&rsquo;re probably discussing how
they can induce you to play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how goes it?&rdquo; called a voice, and they
looked back to see Bricktop Molloy. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
perspiring freely from the hard practice he had
been through at tackle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;We were just wondering
if we would make the &rsquo;varsity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure you will,&rdquo; answered the genial Irish
student, who was nothing if not encouraging. Perhaps
it was because he was sure himself of playing
on the first team that he was so confident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you think of Gerhart at quarter?&rdquo;
asked Tom, for the benefit of his chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice him much,&rdquo; answered Bricktop,
as he ruffled his red hair. &ldquo;Seemed to me to be a
bit sloppy, though; and that won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil did not say anything, but he looked relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bad you&rsquo;re not going to play, Sid, old
chap,&rdquo; remarked Tom in the room that night, when
the three chums were together. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know
what you miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I do,&rdquo; was the answer, and Sid looked
up from the depths of the chair, closing his Greek
book. &ldquo;The day has gone by when I want to
have twenty-one husky lads trying to shove my
backbone through my stomach. I don&rsquo;t mind baseball,
but I draw the line at posing as a candidate
for a broken neck or a dislocated shoulder. Not
any in mine, thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a namby-pamby milksop!&rdquo; exclaimed
Phil with a laugh and a pat on the back, that took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
all the sting from the words. &ldquo;Worse than that,
you&rsquo;re a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t stick girls&rsquo; pictures, and banners
worked in silk by the aforesaid damsels, all over
the room,&rdquo; and Sid looked with disapproval on an
emblem which Tom had placed on the wall that
day. It was a silk flag of Randall colors, which
Madge Tyler had given to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a misguided, crusty, hard-shelled troglodytic
specimen of a misogynist!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, fair sir, for the compliment,&rdquo; and Sid
arose to bow elaborately.</p>

<p>Phil and Tom talked football until Sid begged
them to cease, as he wanted to study, and, though
it was hard work, they managed to do so. Soon
they were poring over their books, and all that
was heard in the room was the occasional rattle
of paper, mingling with the ticking of the clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m done for to-night,&rdquo; announced Sid,
after an hour&rsquo;s silence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get up early
and bone away. Hand me that alarm clock, Tom,
and I&rsquo;ll set it for five.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; begged Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because if you do it will go off about one o&rsquo;clock
in the morning. Set it at eleven, and by the law
of averages it ought to go off at five. Try it and
see. I never saw such a clock as that. It&rsquo;s a most
perverse specimen.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Phil&rsquo;s prediction proved, on trial, to be correct,
so Sid set the clock at eleven, and went to bed,
where, a little later, Tom and Phil followed.</p>

<p>There was more football practice the next afternoon,
and also the following day. Tom was doing
better than he expected, but his speed was not yet
equal to the work that would be required of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need quick ends,&rdquo; said the coach in talking
to the candidates during a lull in practice. &ldquo;You
ends must get down the field like lightning on
kicks, and we&rsquo;re going to do a good deal of kicking
this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom felt that he would have to spend some
extra time running, both on the gymnasium track
and across country. His wind needed a little attention,
and he was not a lad to favor himself.
He wanted to be the best end on the team. He
spoke to the coach about it, and was advised to
run every chance he got.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do, I can practically promise you a place
on the eleven,&rdquo; said Mr. Lighton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to be quarter-back?&rdquo; Tom could
not help asking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the frank answer. &ldquo;A
few days ago I would have said Phil Clinton; but
Gerhart, the new man, has been doing some excellent
work recently. I&rsquo;ll be able to tell in a few
days.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Somehow Tom felt a little apprehensive for Phil.
He fancied he could see the hand of Langridge at
work in favor of his freshman chum.</p>

<p>The matter was unexpectedly settled a few days
later. There were two scrub teams lined up, Tom
and Phil being on one, and Gerhart playing at
quarter on the other. There had been some sharp
practice, and a halt was called while the coach gave
the men some instructions. As a signal was about
to be given Phil went over to the coach, and, in a
spirit of the utmost fairness, complained that the
opposing center was continually offending in the
matter of playing off side. Phil suggested that
Mr. Lighton warn him quietly.</p>

<p>The coach nodded comprehendingly, and started
to speak a word of caution. As he passed over to
the opposing side, he saw Gerhart stooping to
receive the ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerhart,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think you would improve
if you would hold your arms a little closer
to your body. Then the ball will come in contact
with your hands and body at the same time, and
there is less chance for a fumble. Here, I&rsquo;ll show
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, when Mr. Lighton started he had no idea
whatever of speaking to Gerhart. It was the center
he had in mind, but he never missed a chance to
coach a player. He came quite close to the quarter-back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and was indicating the position he meant him
to assume, when the coach suddenly started back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerhart, you&rsquo;ve been smoking!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
and he sniffed the air suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not!&rdquo; was the indignant answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t deny it,&rdquo; was the retort of the coach.
&ldquo;I know the smell of cigarettes too well. You may
go to the side lines. Shipman, you come in at
quarter,&rdquo; and he motioned to another player.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Lighton,&rdquo; began Gerhart, &ldquo;I promise&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to promise now,&rdquo; was the answer
the coach made. &ldquo;At the beginning of practice
I warned you all that if you broke training rules
you couldn&rsquo;t play. If you do it now, what will
you do later on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you, I&mdash;er&mdash;I only took a few&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shipman,&rdquo; was all Mr. Lighton said, and then
he spoke to the center.</p>

<p>Gerhart withdrew from the practice, and walked
slowly from the gridiron. As he left the field he
cast a black look at Phil, who, all unconscious of
it, was waiting for the play to be resumed. But
Tom saw it.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes more marked the close of work
for the day. As Tom and Phil were hurrying
to the dressing-rooms, they were met by Langridge
and Gerhart. The latter still had his football togs
on.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Clinton, why did you tell Lighton I had been
smoking?&rdquo; asked Gerhart in sharp tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him you had been smoking? Why, I
didn&rsquo;t know you had been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you did. I saw you whispering to him,
and then he came over and called me down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not! I saw you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil recollected that he had whispered to the
coach. But he could not, in decency, tell what it
was about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never mentioned your name to the coach,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Nor did I speak of smoking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know better!&rdquo; snapped Gerhart. &ldquo;I saw
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can only repeat that I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say you did! You&rsquo;re a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil&rsquo;s face reddened. This insult, and from a
freshman, was more than he could bear. He
sprang at Gerhart with clenched fists, and would
have knocked him down, only Tom clasped his
friend&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not here! Not here!&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t fight here, Phil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somewhere else, then!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. &ldquo;He
shan&rsquo;t insult me like that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; spoke Tom soothingly, for he,
too, resented the words and manner of the freshman.
&ldquo;Langridge, I&rsquo;ll see you about this later if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
you&rsquo;re agreeable,&rdquo; he added significantly, &ldquo;and
will act for your friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Tom&rsquo;s former rival easily. &ldquo;I
guess my friend is willing,&rdquo; and then the two
cronies strolled off.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<h3>PROFESSOR TINES OBJECTS</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Are you going to fight him?&rdquo; asked Langridge
of Gerhart, when they were beyond the hearing of
Tom and Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! I owe him something for being
instrumental in getting me put out of the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure he did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Didn&rsquo;t I see him sneak up to
Lighton and put him wise to the fact that I&rsquo;d
taken a few whiffs? I only smoked half a cigarette
in the dressing-room, but Clinton must have spied
on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Parsons did on me, last term, and
I got dumped for it. There isn&rsquo;t much to this
athletic business, anyway. I don&rsquo;t see why you
go in for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I do, but I&rsquo;m not going to stand for
Clinton butting in the way he did. I wish he had
come at me. You&rsquo;d seen the prettiest fight you ever
witnessed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it,&rdquo; spoke Langridge dryly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked his crony, struck
by some hidden meaning in the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that Clinton would just about have
wiped up the field with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay you ten to one he wouldn&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;ve taken
boxing lessons from a professional,&rdquo; and Gerhart
seemed to swell up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh! That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; declared Langridge.
&ldquo;Phil Clinton has boxed with professionals, and
beaten them, too. We had a little friendly mill
here last term. It was on the quiet, so don&rsquo;t say
anything about it. Phil went up against a heavy
hitter and knocked him out in four rounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did?&rdquo; and Gerhart spoke in a curiously
quiet voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing. I just mention this to show that
you won&rsquo;t have a very easy thing of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was silence between the two for several
seconds. Then Gerhart asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think he wants me to apologize?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; asked his chum, and he looked
sharply at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not a fool. If he&rsquo;s as good as you
say he is, there&rsquo;s no use in me having my face
smashed just for fun. I think he gave me away,
and nothing he can say will change it. Only I
don&rsquo;t mind saying to him that I was mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re sensible there,&rdquo; was Langridge&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
comment. &ldquo;It would be a one-sided fight. Shall
I tell him you apologize?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got to make it as bald as that? Can&rsquo;t
you say I was mistaken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ll try. Clinton is one of those
fellows who don&rsquo;t believe in half-measures. You
leave it to me. I&rsquo;ll fix it up. I don&rsquo;t want to see
you knocked out so early in the term. Besides&mdash;well,
never mind now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Gerhart quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I was going to say we&rsquo;d get square on
him some other way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we will!&rdquo; came eagerly from the
deposed quarter-back. &ldquo;I counted on playing football
this term, and he&rsquo;s to blame if I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be so sure about that,&rdquo; came from
Langridge. &ldquo;I never knew Clinton to lie. Maybe
what he says is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it. I think he informed on me,
and I always will. Do you think there&rsquo;s a chance
for me to get back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Lighton is too strict. It&rsquo;s all up with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll have my revenge on Phil Clinton,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; added Langridge eagerly.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any use for him and his crowd. He
pushed me down stairs the other day, and I owe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
him one for that. We&rsquo;ll work together against
him. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a go!&rdquo; and they shook hands over the mean
bargain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll fix it up with him?&rdquo; asked Gerhart
after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, leave it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So that is how it was, that, a couple of hours
later, Tom and Phil received a call from Langridge.
He seemed quite at his ease, in spite of the
feeling that existed between himself and the two
chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know what I&rsquo;ve come for,&rdquo; he
said easily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can guess,&rdquo; spoke Tom. &ldquo;Take a seat,&rdquo;
and he motioned to the old sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks&mdash;not on that. It looks as if it
would collapse. I don&rsquo;t see why you fellows have
such beastly furniture. It&rsquo;s frowsy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We value it for the associations,&rdquo; said Phil
simply. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right, if you care for it. Every one
to his notion, as the poet says. But I came on my
friend Gerhart&rsquo;s account. He says he was mistaken
about you, Clinton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that mean he apologizes?&rdquo; asked Phil
stiffly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, you old fire-eater,&rdquo; said Langridge,
lighting a cigarette. &ldquo;Is it satisfactory?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but tell him to be more careful in the
future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess he will be. He&rsquo;s heard of your
reputation,&rdquo; and Langridge blew a ring of smoke
toward the ceiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take him on, if he thinks Phil is too much
for him,&rdquo; said Tom with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks; he&rsquo;s satisfied, but it&rsquo;s hard lines
that he can&rsquo;t play,&rdquo; observed the bearer of the
apology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my fault,&rdquo; said Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not. Well, I&rsquo;ll be going,&rdquo; and,
having filled the room with particularly pungent
smoke, Langridge took his departure. If Tom
and Phil could have seen him in the hall, a moment
later, they would have observed him shaking his
fist at the closed door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Open a window, Phil.
It smells as if the place had been disinfected!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse! I wonder what sort of dope they put
in those cigarettes? I like a good pipe or a cigar,
but I&rsquo;m blessed if I can go those coffin nails! Ah,
that air smells good,&rdquo; and he breathed in deep of
the September air at the window.</p>

<p>Thus it was that there came about no fight between
Phil and the &ldquo;sporty freshman,&rdquo; as he began
to be called. There was some disappointment,
among the students who liked a &ldquo;mill,&rdquo; but as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
there were sure to be fights later in the term, they
consoled themselves.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the football practice went on. Candidates
were being weeded out, and many were
dropped. Gerhart made an unsuccessful attempt
to regain his place at quarter, but the coach was
firm; and though Langridge used all his influence,
which was not small, it had no effect. Gerhart
would not be allowed to play on the &rsquo;varsity (which
was the goal of every candidate), though he was
allowed to line up with the scrub.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll get even with Clinton for this,&rdquo; he said
more than once to his crony, who eagerly assented.</p>

<p>Phil, meanwhile, was clinching his position at
quarter, and was fast developing into a &ldquo;rattling
good player,&rdquo; as Holly Cross said. Tom was not
quite sure of his place at end, though he was improving,
and ran mile after mile to better his wind
and speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming on,&rdquo; said Coach Lighton enthusiastically.
&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll do, Tom. Keep it
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There had been particularly hard practice one
afternoon, and word went down the line for some
kicking. The backs fell to it with vigor, and the
pigskin was &ldquo;booted&rdquo; all over the field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for a good try at goal!&rdquo; called the coach,
as the ball was passed to Holly Cross, who was
playing at full-back. He drew back his foot, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
his shoe made quite a dent in the side of the ball.
But, as often occurs, the kick was not a success.
The spheroid went to the side, sailing low, and out
of bounds.</p>

<p>As it happened, Professor Emerson Tines, who
had been dubbed &ldquo;Pitchfork&rdquo; the very first time
the students heard his name, was crossing the field
at that moment. He was looking at a book of
Greek, and paying little attention to whither his
steps led. The ball was coming with terrific speed
directly at his back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out, professor!&rdquo; yelled a score of voices.</p>

<p>Mr. Tines did look, but not in the right direction.
He merely gazed ahead, and seeing nothing,
and being totally oblivious to the football practice,
he resumed his reading.</p>

<p>The next moment, with considerable speed, <a href="#image02">the
pigskin struck him full in the back</a>. It caught him
just as he had lifted one foot to avoid a stone, and
his balance was none too good. Down he went in
a heap, his book flying off on a tangent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">
<a name="image02" id="image02"><img src="images/image02.jpg" width="379" height="600" alt="The pigskin struck him full in the back" title="The pigskin struck him full in the back" />
</a><br /><span class="caption">&ldquo;<a href="#Page_58">The pigskin struck him full in the back</a>&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; exclaimed Holly Cross, who had been
the innocent cause of the downfall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in for
it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep mum, everybody, as to who did it,&rdquo; proposed
Phil. &ldquo;The whole crowd will shoulder the
blame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The players started on the run toward the professor,
who still reclined in a sprawling attitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
on the ground. He was the least liked of all the
faculty, yet the lads could do no less than go to his
assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s hurt,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too tough for that,&rdquo; was the opinion of
Bricktop.</p>

<p>Before the crowd of players reached the prostrate
teacher he had arisen. His face was first red
and then pale by turns, so great was his rage. He
looked at the dirt on his clothes, and then at his
book, lying face downward some distance away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young gentlemen!&rdquo; he cried in his sternest
voice. &ldquo;Young gentlemen, I object to this! Most
emphatically do I object! You have gone entirely
too far! It is disgraceful! You shall hear further
of this! You may all report to me in half an hour
in my room! I most seriously object! It is disgraceful
that such conduct should be allowed at
any college! I shall speak to Dr. Churchill and
enter a most strenuous objection! The idea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He replaced his glasses, which had fallen off, and
accepted his book that Tom picked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; he added severely. &ldquo;I shall expect
you all to report to me in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment Dr. Albertus Churchill, the
aged and dignified head of the college, and Mr.
Andrew Zane, a proctor, came strolling along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I shall report your disgraceful conduct
to Dr. Churchill at once,&rdquo; added Professor Tines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
as he walked toward the venerable, white-haired
doctor. &ldquo;I shall enter my strongest objection to
the continuance of football here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were blank looks on the faces of the players.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<h3>THE FIRST LINE-UP</h3>


<p>Evidently Dr. Churchill surmised that something
unusual had occurred, for he changed his
slow pace to a faster gait as he approached the
football squad, in front of which stood Professor
Tines, traces of anger still on his unpleasant face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, young gentlemen, at football practice, I
see,&rdquo; remarked the doctor, smiling. &ldquo;I trust there
is the prospect of a good team, Mr. Lighton. I
was very well pleased with the manner in which
the baseball nine acquitted itself, and I trust that
at the more strenuous sport the colors of Randall
will not be trailed in the dust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if I can help it, sir; nor the boys, either,&rdquo;
replied the coach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; added Captain Holly Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you also take an interest in the sport,&rdquo;
went on Dr. Churchill to Professor Tines. &ldquo;I am
glad the members of the faculty lend their presence
to sports. Nothing is so ennobling&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried Professor Tines, unable to contain
himself any longer, &ldquo;I have been grossly insulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to-day. I wish to enter a most emphatic protest
against the continuance of football at this college.
But a moment ago, as I was crossing the field, reading
this Greek volume, I was knocked over by the
ball. I now formally demand that football be
abolished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Churchill looked surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want the guilty one punished,&rdquo; went on Professor
Tines. &ldquo;Who kicked that ball at me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, young gentlemen, who did it?&rdquo; repeated
the proctor, for he thought it was time for him to
take a hand. &ldquo;I demand to know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t any one in particular, sir,&rdquo; answered
Coach Lighton, determined to defend his lads.
&ldquo;It was done on a new play we were trying, and it
would be hard to say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think perhaps I had better investigate,&rdquo; said
Dr. Churchill. &ldquo;Young gentlemen, kindly report
at my study in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; spoke Phil Clinton, &ldquo;Professor
Tines asked us to call and see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I did not know that. Then I waive my
right&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I waive mine,&rdquo; interrupted the Latin
teacher, and he smoothed out some of the pages
in the Greek book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had better have them all up to my
office,&rdquo; proposed the proctor. &ldquo;It is larger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good idea,&rdquo; said the president of Randall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
&ldquo;Gentlemen, you may report to the proctor in half
an hour. I like to see the students indulge in sports,
but when it comes to such rough play that the life
of one of my teachers is endangered, it is time to
call a halt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His life wasn&rsquo;t in any danger,&rdquo; murmured
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; whispered the coach. &ldquo;Leave it to me,
and it will come out all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if they abolish football!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil.
&ldquo;That will be too much! We&rsquo;ll revolt!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll not abolish it. I&rsquo;ll make some explanation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Churchill, Professor Tines, and the proctor
moved away, leaving a very disconsolate group of
football candidates on the gridiron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Pitchfork will prevail upon
Moses to make us stop the game?&rdquo; asked Jerry
Jackson. &ldquo;Moses,&rdquo; as has been explained, being
the students&rsquo; designation of Dr. Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get up a counter protest to Pitchfork&rsquo;s
if they do,&rdquo; added his brother, Joe Jackson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for the Jersey twins!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom.
The two brothers, who looked so much alike that it
was difficult to distinguish them, were from the
&ldquo;Garden State,&rdquo; and thus had gained their nickname.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that sure was an unlucky kick of mine,&rdquo;
came from Holly Cross sorrowfully.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! You&rsquo;re not to blame,&rdquo; said Kindlings
Woodhouse. &ldquo;It might have happened to
any of us. We&rsquo;ll all hang together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or else we&rsquo;ll hang separately, as one of the
gifted signers of the Fourth of July proclamation
put it,&rdquo; added Ed Kerr. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go take our
medicine like little soldiers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In somewhat dubious silence they filed up to the
proctor&rsquo;s office. It was an unusual sight to see
the entire football squad thus in parade, and scores
of students came from their rooms to look on.</p>

<p>Dr. Churchill and Professor Tines were on hand
to conduct the investigation. The latter stated his
case at some length, and reiterated his demand that
football be abolished. In support of his contention
he quoted statistics to show how dangerous
the game was, how many had been killed at it, and
how often innocent spectators, like himself, were
sometimes hurt, though, he added, he would never
willingly be a witness of such a brutal sport.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, young gentlemen, what have you to say
for yourselves?&rdquo; asked Dr. Churchill, and Tom
thought he could detect a twinkle in the president&rsquo;s
eye.</p>

<p>Then Coach Lighton, who was a wise young man,
began a defense. He told what a fine game football
was, how it brought out all that was best in
a lad, and how sorry the entire squad was that any
indignity had been put upon Professor Tines. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
was held in high esteem by all the students, Mr.
Lighton said, which was true enough, though esteem
and regard are very different.</p>

<p>Finally the coach, without having hinted in the
least who had kicked the ball that knocked the
professor down, offered, on behalf of the team, to
present a written apology, signed by every member
of the squad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure nothing can be more fair than that,&rdquo;
declared Dr. Churchill. &ldquo;I admit that I should be
sorry to see football abolished here, Professor
Tines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Tines had gained his point, however,
and was satisfied. He had made himself very important,
and had, as he supposed, vindicated his
dignity. The apology was then and there drawn
up by the proctor, and signed by the students.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must ask for one stipulation,&rdquo; said the still
indignant instructor. &ldquo;I must insist that, hereafter,
when I, or any other member of the faculty approaches,
all indiscriminate knocking or kicking of
balls cease until we have passed on. In this way
all danger will be avoided.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We agree to that,&rdquo; said Mr. Lighton quickly,
and the incident was considered closed. But Professor
Tines, if he had only known it, was the most
disliked instructor in college from then on. He
had been hated before, but now the venom was
bitter against him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re well out of that,&rdquo; remarked Tom to
Phil, as they went to their room, having gotten
rid of their football togs. &ldquo;I wonder what fun
Pitchfork has in life, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reading Latin and Greek, I guess. That reminds
me, I must bone away a bit myself to-night.
I guess Sid is in,&rdquo; he added, as he heard some one
moving about in the room.</p>

<p>They entered to find their chum standing on a
chair, reaching up to one of the silken banners Tom
had hung with such pride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, you old anchorite! What are you doing?&rdquo;
cried Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m trying to make this room look decent,&rdquo;
said Sid. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it so cluttered up that
I can&rsquo;t stand it! Isn&rsquo;t it enough to have pictures
stuck all over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, you let that banner alone!&rdquo; cried Tom,
and he gave such a jerk to the chair on which Sid
was standing that the objector to things artistic
toppled to the floor with a resounding crash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll punch your head!&rdquo; he cried to Tom, who
promptly ensconced himself behind the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurt yourself?&rdquo; asked Phil innocently. &ldquo;If
you did it&rsquo;s a judgment on you, misogynist that you
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dry up!&rdquo; growled Sid, as he rubbed his
shins.</p>

<p>Then, peace having finally been restored, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
all began studying, while waiting for the summons
to supper. When the bell rang, Phil and Tom made
a mad rush for the dining-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Football practice gives you a fine appetite,&rdquo; observed
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you fellows needed any inducement
to make you eat,&rdquo; spoke Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither we do,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;But come on,
Phil, if he gets there first there&rsquo;ll be little left for
us, in spite of his gentle words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have harder work at practice to-morrow,&rdquo;
continued Phil as they sat down at the table. &ldquo;It
will be the first real line-up, and I&rsquo;m anxious to see
how I&rsquo;ll do against Shipman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got Gerhart&rsquo;s place for good, has he?&rdquo;
asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks so. Pass the butter, will you? Do you
want it all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the least, bright-eyes. Here; have a
prune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you fellows make me tired,&rdquo; observed Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you lately, old chap?&rdquo;
asked Tom. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as grumpy as a bear with a
sore nose. Has your girl gone back on you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go again!&rdquo; burst out Sid. &ldquo;Always
talking about girls! I declare, since those pictures
and things are up in the room, you two have gone
daffy! I&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;em all down, first thing you
know.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do, we&rsquo;ll chuck you in the river,&rdquo; promised
Phil.</p>

<p>Thus, amid much good-natured banter, though
to an outsider it might not sound so, the supper
went on. There was more hazing that night, in
which Phil and Tom had a share, but Sid would
not come out, saying he had to study.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Tom,&rdquo; called Phil the next afternoon,
&ldquo;all out for the first real line-up of the season.
I&rsquo;m going to run the &rsquo;varsity against the scrub, and
I want to see how I make out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has the &rsquo;varsity eleven all been picked out?&rdquo;
asked Tom anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Practically so, though, of course, there will be
changes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to go at left-end. Come on, and we&rsquo;ll
get our togs on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a little preliminary practice the two teams
were told to line-up for a short game of fifteen-minute
halves. Coach Lighton named those who
were to constitute a provisional &rsquo;varsity eleven, and,
to his delight, Tom&rsquo;s name was among the first
named. Phil went to quarter, naturally, and several
of Tom&rsquo;s chums found themselves playing
with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now try for quick, snappy work from the
start,&rdquo; was the advice of the coach. &ldquo;Play as
though you meant something, not as if you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
going on a fishing trip, and it didn&rsquo;t matter when
you got there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ball was put into play. The &rsquo;varsity had it,
and under the guidance of Phil Clinton, who gave
his signals rapidly, the scrub was fairly pushed up
the field, and a little later the &rsquo;varsity had scored
a touchdown. Goal was kicked, and then the lads
were ready for another tussle.</p>

<p>The scrub, by dint of extraordinary hard work,
managed to keep the ball for a considerable time,
making the necessary gains by rushes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must hold &rsquo;em, fellows!&rdquo; pleaded Phil, and
Captain Holly Cross added his request to that
end, in no uncertain words.</p>

<p>Shipman, the scrub quarter, passed the pigskin
to his right half-back, and the latter hit the line
hard. Phil Clinton, seeing an opening, dove in for
a tackle. In some way there was a fumble, and
Phil got the ball. The next instant Jerry Jackson,
who was on the &rsquo;varsity, slipped and fell heavily
on Phil&rsquo;s right shoulder. The plucky quarter-back
stifled a groan that came to his lips, and then,
turning over on his back, stretched out white and
still on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phil&rsquo;s hurt!&rdquo; cried Holly Cross. &ldquo;Hold on,
fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom bent over his chum. He felt of his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dislocated,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get the
doctor for him, Holly.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<h3>LANGRIDGE AND GERHART PLOT</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Some of you fellows run for Dr. Marshall!&rdquo;
called Mr. Lighton to the throng that gathered
about the prostrate lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; volunteered Joe Jackson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, let me,&rdquo; said his twin brother. &ldquo;It was
my fault. I slipped and fell on him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t any fellow&rsquo;s fault in particular,&rdquo; declared
the captain. &ldquo;It was likely to happen to
any one. But suppose you twins both go, and
then we&rsquo;ll be sure to have help. If Dr. Marshall
isn&rsquo;t in the college, telephone to Haddonfield for
one. Phil&rsquo;s shoulder must be snapped back into
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the twins started off Phil opened his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurt much, old chap?&rdquo; asked Tom, holding his
chum&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not&mdash;not much,&rdquo; but Phil gritted his
teeth as he said it. His shoulder, with the bunch
of padding on it, stood out oddly from the rest of
his body.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Put some coats under him,&rdquo; ordered the coach.
&ldquo;Shall we carry you inside, Phil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; don&rsquo;t move me. Is my arm broken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; only a dislocation, I guess. You&rsquo;ll be all
right in a few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon enough to play against Boxer Hall, I
hope,&rdquo; said Phil with a faint smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; declared the coach heartily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
delay the game if necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes Dr. Marshall,&rdquo; called Ed Kerr, as
the college physician was seen hurrying across the
campus, with the Jersey twins trailing along behind.</p>

<p>The doctor, after a brief examination, pronounced
it a bad dislocation, but then and there,
with the help of the captain and coach, he reduced
it, though the pain, as the bone snapped into place,
made Phil sick and faint. Then they helped him
to his room, where he was soon visited by scores
of students, for the quarter-back was a general
favorite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I think I will have to establish a quarantine,&rdquo;
declared Dr. Marshall, when about fifty lads
had been in to see how the patient was progressing.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to get a fever from excitement,
Clinton. If you expect to get into the game again
inside of two weeks, you must keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two weeks!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;If I have to stay out
as long as that I&rsquo;ll be so out of form that I&rsquo;ll be
no good.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see how the ligaments get along,&rdquo;
was all the satisfaction the doctor would give the
sufferer.</p>

<p>Tom and Sid remained with their chum, and,
after the physician had left, they made all sorts
of insane propositions to Phil with a view of
making him more comfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I read Greek to you?&rdquo; offered Sid. &ldquo;Maybe
it would take your mind off your trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greek nothing,&rdquo; replied Phil with a smile.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I troubles enough without that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had some cheese I would make a Welsh
rarebit,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;I used to be quite handy
at it; not the stringy kind, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out, you old rounder!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid.
&ldquo;Welsh rarebit would be a fine thing for an invalid,
wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe fried oysters would be better,&rdquo;
admitted Tom dubiously. &ldquo;I could smuggle some
in the room, only the measly things drip so, and
Proc. Zane has been unusually active of late in
sending his scouts around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you can do, if you want to,&rdquo;
spoke Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send word to my sister, over at Fairview. She
may hear something about this, and imagine it&rsquo;s
worse than it is. I&rsquo;d like her to get it straight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
I got a letter from dad to-day, too, saying mother
was a little better. I&rsquo;d like sis to read it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go myself, and start right away!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tom enthusiastically. &ldquo;I can get permission easily
enough, for I&rsquo;ve been doing good work in class
lately. I&rsquo;ll come back on the midnight trolley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfully anxious to go, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;Why do you speak
so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe Miss Madge Tyler attends at Fairview,&rdquo;
went on Sid to no one in particular, and
there was a mocking smile on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you just wait!&rdquo; cried Tom, shaking his
fist at his chum, who sank down into the depths
of the old easy chair, and held up his feet as
fenders to keep the indignant one at a distance.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get yours good and proper some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re going, you&rsquo;d better start,&rdquo; said
Phil. &ldquo;I forgot, though. You&rsquo;ve never met my
sister. That&rsquo;s a go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give me a note to her?&rdquo; asked Tom,
who was fertile in expedients where young ladies
were concerned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess so. Lucky it&rsquo;s my left instead of my
right shoulder that&rsquo;s out of business. Give me
some paper, Sid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom doesn&rsquo;t need a note,&rdquo; was the opinion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the amateur woman-hater. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll see Miss Tyler,
and she&rsquo;ll introduce him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Tom, as if he had just
thought of it. &ldquo;That will do first rate. Never
mind the note, Phil,&rdquo; and he hurried off, lest
something might occur that would prevent his
visit.</p>

<p>He readily obtained permission to go to Fairview
Institute, and was soon hurrying along the
river road to catch a trolley car. As he crossed a
bridge over the stream, he heard voices on the
farther end. It was dusk, now, and he could not
see who the speakers were. But he heard this
conversation:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear about Clinton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; he&rsquo;s laid up with a bad shoulder. Well,
it may be just the chance we want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; thought Tom. &ldquo;I wonder who
they can be? Evidently college fellows. Yet how
can Phil&rsquo;s injury give them the chance they want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kept on, and a moment later came in sight
of the speakers. He saw that they were Fred
Langridge and Garvey Gerhart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said Tom civily enough, for,
though he and Langridge were not on the best of
terms, they still spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Off on a lark?&rdquo; asked the former pitcher with a
sneer. &ldquo;I thought you athletic chaps didn&rsquo;t do
any dissipating.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to,&rdquo; said Tom shortly, as he
passed on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose he heard what we said?&rdquo; asked
Gerhart, as the shadows swallowed up Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but it doesn&rsquo;t make much difference. He
wouldn&rsquo;t understand. Now, do you think you
can do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. What I want to do is to keep him
laid up for several weeks. That will give me an
opportunity of getting back on the eleven. He was
responsible for me being dropped, and now it&rsquo;s
my turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But are you sure it will work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. I know just how to make the
stuff. A fellow told me. If we can substitute it
for his regular liniment it will do the trick all
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That part will be easy enough. I can think
up a scheme for that. But will it do him any permanent
harm? I shouldn&rsquo;t want to get into
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t harm him any. It will make him
so he can&rsquo;t use his arm for a while, but that&rsquo;s what
we want. The effects will pass away in about a
month, just too late to let him get on the eleven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right; if you know what you&rsquo;re doing, I&rsquo;ll
help. Now then, where will we get the stuff?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know all about that part. But let&rsquo;s get off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
this bridge. It&rsquo;s too public. Come to a quieter
place, where we can talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know a good place. There&rsquo;s a quiet little
joint in town, where we can get a glass of beer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it be safe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. Come on,&rdquo; and Langridge and his crony
disappeared in the darkness, talking, meanwhile,
of a dastardly plot they had evolved to disable
Phil Clinton.</p>

<p>Tom kept on his way to the trolley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Langridge and Gerhart meant?&rdquo;
he thought as he quickened his pace on hearing
an approaching car. &ldquo;Perhaps Gerhart thought
he had a chance to get back on the team, because
Phil is laid up. But I don&rsquo;t believe he has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Tom&rsquo;s interpretation of the words he had
heard was far from the truth. Phil Clinton was
in grave danger.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<h3>SOME GIRLS</h3>


<p>Tom thought the fifteen-mile trolley ride to Fairview
was an unusually long one, but, as a matter
of fact, it was soon accomplished, for he caught
an express, and about eight o&rsquo;clock that night arrived
in the town where the co-educational institution
was located.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now to find Phil&rsquo;s sister,&rdquo; he said half aloud,
as he headed for the college. He knew the way
well, for he had been there several times before
in the previous spring, when his team played baseball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Parsons,&rdquo; a voice greeted him as he was
walking up the campus. &ldquo;Where you bound for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speaker was Frank Sullivan, manager of
the Fairview ball team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just came over to see what sort of a
football eleven you were going to stack up against
us this fall,&rdquo; answered Tom easily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not very good, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; declared Frank.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in pretty bad shape. Several of our best
men have been hurt in practice.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a few cripples ourselves,&rdquo; said
Tom. &ldquo;Phil Clinton just got laid up with a bad
shoulder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our half-back is a wreck,&rdquo; added Frank.</p>

<p>It is curious, but true, nevertheless, that most
football elevens seem to rejoice in the number of
cripples they can boast of. The worse the men
are &ldquo;banged up,&rdquo; the better those interested in the
team seem to be. It may be that they wish to
conceal from other teams their real condition, and
so give the enemy a false idea of their strength.
However that may be, the fact remains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you came over to see how we were doing,
eh?&rdquo; went on Frank. &ldquo;Well, not very good, I&rsquo;m
afraid. We expect to be the tailenders this season,&rdquo;
which was not at all what Frank expected,
however, nor did his friends. But he considered
it policy to say so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come over for that alone,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;I have a message to Phil&rsquo;s sister. Say, how do
you get into the female department of this shebang,
anyhow? What&rsquo;s the proper method of
procedure? Do I have to have the password and
a countersign?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty nearly. It&rsquo;s like the combination on a
safe. The first thing you will have to do is to
go and interview Miss Philock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The preceptress; and a regular ogress into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
bargain. If you pass muster with her first inspection,
you&rsquo;ll have to answer a lot of categorical
questions covering your whole life history. Then,
maybe, she&rsquo;ll consent to take a note from you to
the fair damsel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I see her?&rdquo; asked Tom in some dismay,
for he had counted on meeting Madge Tyler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See a girl student of Fairview after dark?
Why, the idea is preposterous, my dear sir! Perfectly
scandalous!&rdquo; and Frank gave a fair imitation
of an indignant lady teacher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll have to send word in,&rdquo; decided Tom,
&ldquo;for I didn&rsquo;t bring a note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know her personally?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;Miss Philock or Phil&rsquo;s sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phil&rsquo;s sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse and more of it. I wish you joy of your
job. But I&rsquo;m off. There&rsquo;s going to be some hazing,
and I&rsquo;m on the committee to provide some
extra tortures for the freshies. So long. Miss
Philock has her den in that red building on your
left,&rdquo; and, whistling a merry air, which was utterly
out of keeping with Tom&rsquo;s spirits, Frank Sullivan
walked away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here goes,&rdquo; said Tom to himself, as he
walked up to the residence of the preceptress and
rang the bell.</p>

<p>An elderly servant answered his summons, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
looked very much surprised at observing a good-looking
youth standing on the steps. Tom asked
to see Miss Philock, and the servant, after shutting
the door, and audibly locking it, walked away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must be terribly afraid of me,&rdquo; thought
Tom, but further musings were put to an end by
the arrival of the preceptress herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want, young man?&rdquo; she asked,
and her voice sounded like some file rasping and
scraping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to deliver a message to Miss Ruth
Clinton,&rdquo; was Tom&rsquo;s answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Thomas Parsons, of Randall College.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you any relation to Miss Clinton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but I room with her brother, and he was
slightly hurt in football practice to-day. He wanted
me to tell her that it was nothing serious. He
also has a letter from his father, that he wished
me to deliver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Philock fairly glared at Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a very ingenious and plausible answer,&rdquo;
said the elderly lady slowly. &ldquo;I have had
many excuses made to me by young gentlemen as
reasons for sending messages to young ladies under
my care, but this one is the most ingenious I have
ever received.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; insisted Tom, who perceived
that his story was not believed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they all say,&rdquo; was the calm answer
of Miss Philock.</p>

<p>Tom was nonplused. He hardly knew what
reply to make.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are evidently a stranger to our rules,&rdquo;
went on Miss Philock. &ldquo;You must go away at
once, or I shall notify the proctor,&rdquo; and she was
about to close the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried Tom desperately, &ldquo;I have a message
for Miss Ruth Clinton!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you a relative of hers?&rdquo; again asked the
preceptress coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; not exactly,&rdquo; spoke Tom slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way they all say it,&rdquo; she went on.
&ldquo;If you are not a relative you can send her no
message.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t you tell her what I&rsquo;ve told you?&rdquo;
asked the &rsquo;varsity pitcher. &ldquo;She may worry about
her brother, and he wants her to have this letter
from her father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know she has a brother?&rdquo; asked
Miss Philock sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am telling you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; frigidly. &ldquo;Other young men
have called here to see the young ladies under my
charge, and they often pretend to be brothers and
cousins, when they were not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not pretending.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you are or not, sir. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
has been my experience that you can never trust
a young man. I shall have to bid you good evening,
though I do you the credit to state that your
plan is a very good one. Only, I am too sharp
for you, young man. You can send no message
to Miss Clinton or any other young lady student
under my charge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door was almost shut. Tom was in despair.
At that moment he caught sight of a girlish figure
in the hall behind the preceptress. It was Madge
Tyler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Madge&mdash;Miss Tyler!&rdquo; he cried impulsively,
&ldquo;will you tell Miss Clinton that her brother is
not badly hurt. That is, in case she hears any
rumors. His shoulder is dislocated, but he&rsquo;s all
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Parsons&mdash;Tom!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl
in surprise. &ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young man, what do you mean by disobeying
my orders in this manner?&rdquo; demanded Miss Philock,
bristling with anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me not to speak to Miss Tyler,&rdquo;
said Tom slyly. And he smiled mischievously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Tyler&mdash;do you know her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am an old friend of hers,&rdquo; insisted Tom
quickly, his confidence coming back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this true, Miss Tyler?&rdquo; asked the head instructress.</p>

<p>Madge was a bright girl, and a quick thinker.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
She at once understood Tom&rsquo;s predicament, and
resolved to help him out. Perhaps it was as much
on her own account as Ruth&rsquo;s&mdash;who knows? At
any rate, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Miss Philock, Tom Parsons and I have
known each other ever since we were children.
He is a sort of distant relation of mine. Aren&rsquo;t
you, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;yes, Madge,&rdquo; he almost stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His mother and my mother are second cousins,&rdquo;
went on the girl, which was true enough, though
Tom had forgotten it. He did not stop to figure
out just what degree of kinship he bore to Madge.
He was satisfied to have it as it was. Miss Philock
turned to Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had known this at first,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I would
have allowed you to send a message to Miss Tyler
at once. However strongly young gentlemen may
insist that they are related to my girls, I never
believe them. But if the statement is made by
one of my pupils, I never doubt her. In view of
the fact that you have come some distance, you
may step into the parlor, and speak with Miss
Tyler for ten minutes&mdash;no longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She opened the door wider. It was quite a different
reception from what Tom had expected, but
he was glad enough to see Madge for even that
brief period. He followed her into the parlor,
while Miss Philock passed down the corridor.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, I&rsquo;m so glad to see you!&rdquo; exclaimed
the girl, and she extended both hands, which Tom
held just as long as he decently could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad to see you,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
looking fine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about Ruth&rsquo;s brother?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. He was hurt at football practice this
afternoon, and he was afraid she&rsquo;d worry. I told
him I&rsquo;d bring a message to her, and also this letter.
It&rsquo;s from her father, about her mother. Will you
give it to her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. Isn&rsquo;t it too bad about her poor,
dear mother? Ruth is such a sweet girl. Have
you ever met her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had the pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I&rsquo;d better introduce you to her,&rdquo;
said Madge musingly. &ldquo;She is very fascinating,
and&mdash;er&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She looked at Tom and
laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you doubt me?&rdquo; asked Tom, also laughing,
and he bowed low, with his hand on his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Men&mdash;especially young men&mdash;are never
faithless!&rdquo; she exclaimed gaily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how can you present me to her, when the
&lsquo;ogress,&rsquo; as I have heard her called, bars the way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! She may hear you,&rdquo; cautioned Madge.
&ldquo;Oh, we have &lsquo;ways that are dark and tricks that
are vain,&rsquo; I suppose Miss Philock would say. I&rsquo;ll
just send a message by wireless, and Ruth will soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
be here. I think it will be safe. Philly, as we call
her, will be in her office by this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madge stepped to the steam pipes in the room,
and with her pencil tapped several times in a
peculiar way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a code message to Ruth to come down
here,&rdquo; she explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great system,&rdquo; complimented Tom.
&ldquo;How do you work it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we have a code. Each girl has a number,
and we just tap that number on the pipes. You
know, you can hear a tap all over the building.
Then, after giving the number, we rap out the message,
also by numbers. We just <i>had</i> to invent it.
You boys have ever so many things that we girls
can&rsquo;t, you know. Now tell me all about football.
I suppose you will play?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Phil&mdash;I mean Mr. Clinton, but I call him
Phil, because I hear Ruth speak of him so often&mdash;I
think he plays half-back, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; quarter,&rdquo; answered Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope to meet him soon,&rdquo; went on Madge.
&ldquo;Ruth has promised&mdash;&mdash; Oh, here she is now,&rdquo;
she interrupted herself to say. &ldquo;Come in, Ruth,
dear. Here is a sort of forty-second cousin of mine,
with a message about your brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom looked up, to see a tall, dark, handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
girl entering the room. Behind her came a rather
stout, light-haired maiden, with laughing blue eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A message from my brother!&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth,
and she looked at Tom in a manner that made his
heart beat rather faster than usual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ruth,&rdquo; went on Madge; &ldquo;but nothing
serious. I&rsquo;m glad you came down, too, Sarah,
dear. I want you to meet my cousin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought Sarah because I was afraid I didn&rsquo;t
get your pipe message just right,&rdquo; explained Ruth.
&ldquo;Did you mean you had company you wanted to
share with me, or that there was a letter for me?
I couldn&rsquo;t find the code book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s both,&rdquo; declared Madge with a laugh. &ldquo;But
first let&rsquo;s get the introductions over with,&rdquo; and she
presented Tom to Ruth, and then to Miss Sarah
Warden, her roommate, as well as Ruth&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phil has often spoken to me about you, Miss
Clinton,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;In fact, he has your picture
in our room. It doesn&rsquo;t look like you&mdash;I mean
it doesn&rsquo;t do you justice&mdash;that is&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;I
mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better stop, Tom,&rdquo; cautioned Madge. &ldquo;Evidently
Ruth has played havoc with you already.
You should study more carefully the art of making
compliments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Clinton needs no compliments other than
unspoken ones,&rdquo; said Tom, with an elaborate bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how prettily said!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Warden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
&ldquo;Madge, why didn&rsquo;t you tell us about your
cousin before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time enough now,&rdquo; was Madge&rsquo;s rejoinder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what about my brother?&rdquo; asked Ruth anxiously.</p>

<p>Then Tom told her, and gave her the letter
with which Phil had entrusted him. The young
people talked gaily for some minutes longer, and
then Madge, with a look at the clock, said that
it was about time Miss Philock would be back to
see that Tom had not overstayed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a short ten minutes!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and
he looked full in Ruth Clinton&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;However, I hope
you will come again&mdash;that is&mdash;of course you can&rsquo;t
come here, but perhaps we&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
She stopped in confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re almost as bad as Tom was!&rdquo; declared
Madge, and there was just a little change from
her former genial tones. She glanced critically at
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect to come over again,&rdquo; replied Phil&rsquo;s
chum. &ldquo;And I hope I shall see you then, Miss
Clinton&mdash;see all of you, of course,&rdquo; he added
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It depends on Miss Philock,&rdquo; said Miss
Warden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be at the Fairview-Randall football
game?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Ruth, for he looked at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall see you and Madge, then, I hope, only
it&rsquo;s a long way off,&rdquo; and Tom sighed just the least
bit.</p>

<p>Madge raised her eyebrows. She might be pardoned
for considering that Tom, in a measure,
was her personal property, and now, the first time
he had met Ruth, to hear him talk thus, was something
of a shock.</p>

<p>But she was too proud to show more than a
mere hint of her feelings, and Ruth was, for the
time being, entirely unaware that her friend was
a bit jealous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes Philly!&rdquo; exclaimed Sarah Warden,
as steps were heard approaching. &ldquo;You had better
go, Mr. Parsons, if you value your reputation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; spoke Madge; &ldquo;better go, Tom. Sorry
you couldn&rsquo;t stay longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; was his answer, and once more he
looked straight at Ruth. He had thought Madge
very pretty, and, while he did not waver in the
least in still thinking her most attractive, he had
to admit to himself that Ruth&rsquo;s was of a different
style of beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know how to thank you for
taking the trouble to bring me this message and
letter,&rdquo; said Phil&rsquo;s sister, as she held out her hand
to Tom. He took it in a firm clasp.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was only a pleasure,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Next time
I hope to bring better news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there is to be a next time?&rdquo; she asked
archly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he replied, and laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry, Tom, or Miss Philock may order you
out,&rdquo; urged Madge. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve overstayed your
leave as it is, and she may punish us for it. Good-by,&rdquo;
and she held out her hand. Tom clasped it,
but a careful observer, with a split-second watch,
might have noted that he did not hold it quite as
long as he had held Ruth&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Tom was out on the campus,
walking toward the trolley that would take
him to Haddonfield. His brain was in something
of a whirl, and his heart was strangely light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! but she&rsquo;s pretty!&rdquo; he exclaimed half aloud.
&ldquo;What fine eyes! I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash; Oh, well, what&rsquo;s the
use of talking to yourself?&rdquo; And with that sage
reflection Tom pursued his silent way.</p>

<p>Back in the parlor the three girls stood for a
moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like your cousin very much, Madge, dear,&rdquo;
said Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder!&rdquo; exclaimed Madge shortly,
and she turned and hurried from the room.</p>

<p>Ruth looked at her in some surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever has come over Madge?&rdquo; asked Sarah
Warden.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; replied Ruth, and then, with
a thoughtful look on her face, she went to her
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! I guess I know,&rdquo; murmured Miss
Warden, as she followed.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<h3>A BOTTLE OF LINIMENT</h3>


<p>Tom thought of many things as he walked up
the silent campus at Randall, and prepared to go
to his room. He went over again every happening
from the time Miss Philock had grudgingly
admitted him at Fairview, until he had bidden
Ruth Clinton good-by. Tom had a very distinct
mental picture of two girls&rsquo; faces now, whereas,
up to that evening, he had had but one. They
were the faces of Ruth and Madge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it all!&rdquo; he burst out, as he was on the
steps of the west dormitory. &ldquo;I must be falling in
love! This will never do, with the football season
about to open. Better cut it out, Tom Parsons!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His musing was suddenly interrupted by the appearance
of a figure coming quickly from the teachers&rsquo;
residence, which was directly in front of the
dormitory building. The figure exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proctor Zane!&rdquo; whispered Tom to himself.
&ldquo;He thinks he&rsquo;s caught me. Probably he doesn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
know I&rsquo;ve got a permit. I&rsquo;ll have some fun with
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment later the proctor stood beside Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you aware of the hour?&rdquo; asked Mr. Zane,
in what he meant to be a sarcastic tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I believe it&rsquo;s nearly two o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; replied
Tom. &ldquo;I will tell you exactly in a moment, as
soon as I look at my watch,&rdquo; and with a flourish
he drew his timepiece from his pocket. &ldquo;It lacks
just eight minutes of two,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you the time!&rdquo; exclaimed the proctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir; I thought you did,&rdquo;
spoke Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you getting in rather late?&rdquo; asked the
official, as he drew out his book and prepared to
enter Tom&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it might be called late,&rdquo; admitted Tom,
as if there was some doubt about it. &ldquo;That is,
unless you choose to look at it from another standpoint,
and call it early morning. On the whole, I
think I prefer the latter method. It is more comforting,
Mr. Zane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of your impertinence, Parsons!&rdquo; exclaimed
the proctor. &ldquo;You are out after hours,
and you will report to my office directly after
chapel. This matter of students staying out must
be broken up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; went on Tom easily, &ldquo;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t report to you after chapel to-morrow,
or, rather, to-day, Mr. Zane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t? What do you mean, Parsons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, I have to attend a lecture by
Moses&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;Dr. Churchill&mdash;at
that hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The proctor, as Tom could see in the light of
the hall lamp, as the rays streamed from the glass
door of the dormitory, looked pained at the appellation
of &ldquo;Moses&rdquo; to the venerable head of the college.
The boys all called Dr. Churchill that among
themselves, though they meant no disrespect. They
had evolved the title from his name; from the fact
that, as one of the first students put it, the original
Moses went up on a hill to establish the first
church&mdash;hence Church&mdash;Hill; and thus &ldquo;Moses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure Dr. Churchill will excuse you when
he knows the circumstances, Parsons,&rdquo; went on the
proctor with a malicious smile. &ldquo;You will report
to me for being out after hours without permission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I have permission,&rdquo; spoke Tom, as
he drew out a note which the president had given
him. &ldquo;I beg your pardon for not mentioning it
before. Very stupid of me, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; and this
time it was Tom&rsquo;s turn to grin.</p>

<p>The proctor looked at the permit, saw that it
was in regular form, and knew that he was beaten.
Without a word he turned and went back to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
apartments, but the look he gave Tom augured no
good to the talented pitcher. Tom went to his
room, chuckling to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Phil, who was not asleep when
Tom entered. &ldquo;Did you see Ruth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, old chap. It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; and Tom told
something of his visit&mdash;that is, as much as he
thought Phil would care to know. &ldquo;Your sister
and Miss Tyler are both sorry you were laid up,&rdquo;
he went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll be out inside of a week,&rdquo; said Phil.
&ldquo;The doc was here a while ago, and left some new
liniment that he said would soften up the strained
muscles and ligaments. I tried some, and I feel
better already. Say, put that blamed alarm clock
out in the hall, will you? I can&rsquo;t sleep with the
ticking of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom did so, and then undressed. He turned the
light down low, and, as he put on his pajamas, he
knew, by the regular breathing of Phil, that the
injured lad had fallen into a slumber. Sid, too,
was sound asleep. Tom sat down on the old sofa,
sinking far down into the depths of the weak
springs. It creaked like an old man uttering his
protest against rheumatic joints, and, in spite of
the new leg Phil had put on and the strengthening
boards, it threatened to collapse. Tom sat there
in the half darkness dreaming&mdash;reflecting of his
visit to Fairview. He imagined he could see, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the gloom of a distant corner, a fair face&mdash;which
one was it?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve got to cut this out,&rdquo; he remarked, and
then he extinguished the light and got into bed.</p>

<p>The next day was Saturday, and as several of
the football squad were a little lame, Coach
Lighton only put them through light practice.
Thus the absence of Phil was not felt. He was
much better, the new liniment working like a
charm.</p>

<p>One afternoon, a few days later, Tom and Sid
went for a walk, Tom as a matter of training, and
Sid because he wanted to get some specimens for
use in his biology class. They strolled toward the
town of Haddonfield, and shortly after crossing
the bridge over Sunny River, saw on the road ahead
of them two figures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are Langridge and Gerhart,&rdquo; remarked
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; spoke Sid. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re quite chummy for a
freshman and a sophomore. Langridge tried to
save Gerhart from being hazed, but the fellows
wouldn&rsquo;t stand for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say not. He ought to take his medicine
the same as the rest of us had to. But look,
they don&rsquo;t seem to want to meet us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Tom spoke, Langridge and his crony suddenly
left the road and took to the woods which lined
the highway on either side.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what they did that for?&rdquo; went on
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess they don&rsquo;t like our style,&rdquo; was Sid&rsquo;s
opinion. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not sporty enough for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was not for this reason that Langridge
and Gerhart did not want to meet their two schoolmates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucky we saw them in time,&rdquo; observed Gerhart
to the other, as he and Langridge sneaked along.
&ldquo;They might have asked us why we had gone to
town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t have told them. I guess they
won&rsquo;t pay much attention to us. Are you going
to work the trick to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night, if I have a chance. There&rsquo;s going to
be a meeting of the glee club, and Tom and Sid
both will go. That will leave Phil alone in the
room, and I can get in and make the change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful you&rsquo;re not caught. It&rsquo;s a risky
thing to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, but it&rsquo;s worth the risk if I can get
back on the team. Besides, it won&rsquo;t hurt Clinton
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s your funeral, not mine. You&rsquo;ve got
to stand for it all. I did my share helping plan it.
You&rsquo;ll have to take the blame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what puzzles me is how Clinton can help
knowing it when you change the liniment. As soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
as he uses it he&rsquo;ll see that something is wrong, and
he&rsquo;ll recall that you were in the room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, he won&rsquo;t. You see, the two liquids are
so nearly alike that it&rsquo;s hard to tell the difference.
Then, the beauty of it is that the one I&rsquo;m going
to put in place of his regular liniment doesn&rsquo;t take
effect for twelve hours. So he&rsquo;ll never connect me
with his trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. It&rsquo;s up to you. But come on, let&rsquo;s
get out on the road again. I don&rsquo;t fancy tramping
through the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They emerged at a point some distance back of
Tom and Sid, who continued their walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I tell you I met Langridge and Gerhart
the night I went to see Phil&rsquo;s sister?&rdquo; asked Tom
after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. What were they doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom related the conversation he had heard, and
gave his speculations as to what Gerhart could
have meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s counting on Phil being laid up so
long that he can have his place at quarter-back,&rdquo;
was Sid&rsquo;s opinion, and Tom agreed.</p>

<p>The specimens of unfortunate frogs, to be used
in biology, were stowed away in a box Sid carried,
and then he and Tom turned back to college. That
night they went to a rehearsal of the glee club.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mind staying alone, old chap?&rdquo; asked
Tom of Phil as they prepared to depart.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. Glad to get rid of you. I can move
about the room, doc says, and it isn&rsquo;t so bad as it
might be. I&rsquo;ll be glad to be alone, so I can think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. So long, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was quiet in the room after Tom and Sid had
departed. Phil tried to read, but he was too nervous,
and took no interest in the book. It was out
of the question to study, and, as his shoulder ached,
he went back to bed again. He was in a half doze,
when the door opened and Gerhart entered the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope I didn&rsquo;t disturb you, old chap,&rdquo; he began
with easy familiarity&mdash;entirely too easy, for a
freshman, Phil thought with a scowl. &ldquo;Parsons
and Henderson out?&rdquo; asked Gerhart, as if he
did not know it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, at the meeting of the glee club,&rdquo; answered
Phil shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. I&rsquo;d forgotten. Well, here&rsquo;s a note
for Parsons. Will you see that he gets it?&rdquo; And
Gerhart walked over to the table and laid an envelope
down. There was a miscellaneous collection
on the table. Among other things was a bottle
of liniment which the doctor had left for Phil.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just leave the note here,&rdquo; went on Gerhart.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a swell picture over your bed,&rdquo; he said
quickly, pointing to a sporting print that hung
over Phil&rsquo;s cot.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Naturally, the injured lad turned to see where
Gerhart pointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it will do very well,&rdquo; he answered. He
rather resented this familiarity on the part of a
freshman. Still, as Gerhart had called to leave a
note for Tom, Phil could not order him out, as he
felt like doing. When Phil turned his head back
toward the middle of the room the visitor was
standing near the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll be going,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;ll
be out soon. I&rsquo;m going to make another try with
Lighton, and see if he won&rsquo;t let me play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; spoke Phil, as he turned over to doze.</p>

<p>Gerhart, with an ugly smile on his face, hurried
to his room in the east dormitory. Langridge was
waiting for him there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked the former pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done!&rdquo; exulted Gerhart, producing from
beneath his coat a bottle that had contained liniment.
&ldquo;I threw the stuff out, and now I&rsquo;ll get rid
of the bottle. I guess Phil Clinton won&rsquo;t play
football any more this season!&rdquo; He put the bottle
far back on a closet shelf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you throw that away?&rdquo; asked Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may need it,&rdquo; answered Gerhart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll save
it for a while.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<h3>IN WHICH SOME ONE BECOMES A VICTIM</h3>


<p>When Sid and Tom, after glee club practice that
night, were ascending the stairs to their floor, Sid
stumbled, about half way up the flight. To save
himself from a fall he put out his left hand, and
came down heavily on it. As he did so he uttered
an exclamation of pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gave my thumb a fierce wrench! It hurts like
blazes! Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me I was going to
fall, and I&rsquo;d have stayed in to-night?&rdquo; he asked
half humorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a prophet,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;But come
on to the room, and we&rsquo;ll put some arnica on it.
I&rsquo;ve got some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holding his injured thumb tightly in his other
hand, Sid finished climbing the stairs, declaiming,
meanwhile, against his bad luck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re a regular old woman!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tom. &ldquo;Pretty soon it&rsquo;ll be so bad that if you see
a black cat cross your path you won&rsquo;t go to lectures.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had a black cat to use when I&rsquo;m due in
Latin class,&rdquo; spoke Sid. &ldquo;Positively I get more
and more rotten at that blamed stuff every day! I
need a black cat, or something. Wow! How my
thumb hurts!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Many a time on first
base I&rsquo;ve seen you stop a hot ball, and never say a
word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; declared his chum. &ldquo;Hurry
up and get out your arnica.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you fellows make noise enough,&rdquo; grumbled
Phil at the entrance of his roommates. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sid tried to go upstairs on his hands, and
he didn&rsquo;t make out very well,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got two patients on my list now. How are you,
Phil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so-so. Gerhart was here a while ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was? What did he want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Left a note for you. It&rsquo;s on the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! Invitation to a little spread he&rsquo;s
going to give. Didn&rsquo;t you fellows get any?&rdquo; spoke
Tom as he read it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; and I don&rsquo;t want one,&rdquo; from Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not going,&rdquo; declared Tom. &ldquo;Gerhart
is too much of a cad for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Insufferably so!&rdquo; added Phil. &ldquo;The little puppy
gave himself such airs in here that I wanted to
kick him out. But I wasn&rsquo;t going to say anything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
for I thought you might be getting chummy with
him, Tom, seeing that he left the note for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. I don&rsquo;t know what his object is,
nor why he should invite me. He and Langridge
are a pair, and they can stick together,&rdquo; and Tom
wadded up the invitation and threw it into the
waste basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, if you&rsquo;re going to get the arnica, I wish
you&rsquo;d get a move on,&rdquo; implored Sid, who was
stretched out on the sofa. &ldquo;This hurts me worse
than not knowing my Virgil when I&rsquo;m called on
in Pitchfork&rsquo;s class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it can&rsquo;t hurt very much,&rdquo; said Phil.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid held out a hand, the thumb of which was
beginning to swell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you use some of my liniment instead
of arnica for it?&rdquo; proposed Phil. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just
the stuff for a sprain. Here, pour some on your
hand,&rdquo; and Phil, whose left arm was in a sling,
handed Sid the bottle from the table. Sid poured
a generous quantity on his thumb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out for the rug!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom. &ldquo;Do
you want to spoil it?&rdquo; for the liniment was dripping
from Sid&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spoil it? Spoil this tattered and torn specimen
of a fake oriental?&rdquo; queried Sid with a laugh.
&ldquo;Say, if we spread molasses on it the thing couldn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
look much worse than it does. I&rsquo;ve a good notion
to strike for a new one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; begged Phil. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to clean
our feet when we come in now, and if we had a
new rug we&rsquo;d feel obliged to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, have it your own way,&rdquo; remarked
Tom. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got enough liniment on there
for two thumbs. Here, give me the bottle, and
rub what&rsquo;s on your hand in where the swelling is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid extended the bottle to Tom. Phil, who was
holding the cork, endeavored to insert it during
the transfer. The result was a fumble, the phial
slipped from Sid&rsquo;s grasp, Tom made a grab for
it, but missed, and Phil, with only one good hand,
could do nothing. The bottle crashed to the floor
and broke, the liniment running about in little rivulets
from a sort of central lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you have done it!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and Phil. Why didn&rsquo;t you let me do the
doctoring? You two dopes aren&rsquo;t able to look
after yourselves! Look at the rug now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was as much your fault as ours,&rdquo; declared
Sid. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you grab the bottle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you hand it to me? I like your
nerve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice spot on a rug,&rdquo; said Phil in disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It adds to the beauty,&rdquo; declared Sid. &ldquo;It just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
matches the big grease spot on the other side,
which was left as a souvenir by the former occupants
of this study. They must have made a practice
of dropping bread and butter on the floor about
eight nights a week. But say, if you want to do
something, Tom, rub this stuff into my thumb, will
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure; wait until I pick up this broken glass. I
don&rsquo;t want to cut my feet on it, in case I should
take to walking in my sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was soon vigorously massaging Sid&rsquo;s injured
hand, using a piece of flannel as directed by Phil,
and was given a vote of thanks for the professional
manner in which he did it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about your liniment, Phil,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all gone. The only thing I see for you to
do is to cut out that piece of the rug where it has
soaked in, and bind it on your shoulder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I won&rsquo;t need any more
to-night, and to-morrow I&rsquo;ll get some more from
the doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid was the first to awaken the next morning.
A peculiar sensation about his injured hand called
his attention to it. He pulled it from under the
covers and glanced at it. Then he tried to bend
the fingers. They were as stiff as pieces of wood.
So was the thumb. It was as if it had been encased
in a plaster cast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, you fellows!&rdquo; called Sid in some alarm.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; inquired Tom. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you know it&rsquo;s Sunday, and we can sleep as long as
we like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at my hand! Look at it!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid
tragically. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t use it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something in his tones made Tom get up. He
strode over to the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, that is mighty queer,&rdquo; he remarked, as he
tried to bend Sid&rsquo;s fingers, and could not. &ldquo;You
must have given yourself a fearful knock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or else that liniment wasn&rsquo;t the right thing for
it,&rdquo; added Phil, sitting up. &ldquo;Better call the doc.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<h3>THE FIRST GAME</h3>


<p>The three chums looked at each other. Phil
felt of Sid&rsquo;s curiously stiffened hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it could be the liniment,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve used it right along. It&rsquo;s the same
thing doc gave me. You must have hurt your hand
worse than you thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I did,&rdquo; admitted Sid. So skilfully had
Gerhart carried out his dastardly plot that even
his unusual visit to the room of the trio attached
no suspicion to him. The breaking of the bottle
of liniment destroyed one link in the chain against
him, and it would be difficult to trace anything to
Gerhart now.</p>

<p>Dr. Marshall looked grave when he saw Sid&rsquo;s
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very unusual,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It must have
been something you put on it. The muscles and
tendons have been stiffened. There is a drug which
will do that, but it is comparatively rare. It is
sometimes used, in connection with other things,
to keep down swelling, but never to soften a strain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Are you sure you used only the liniment I left for
Clinton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; declared Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see the bottle,&rdquo; said the physician, as he
twirled his glasses by their cord and looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t; it&rsquo;s all gone,&rdquo; explained Phil, and he
told of the accident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! Very strange,&rdquo; mused Dr. Marshall.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll not be able to use your hand for
a month, Henderson. You have every indication
of having used the peculiar drug I speak of, yet
you say you did not, and I don&rsquo;t see how you could
have, unless it got in the liniment by mistake. And
that it did not is proved by the fact that Clinton
used the same liniment without any ill effects. Only
that Parsons used a rag to rub with, his hand would
be out of commission, too. It is very strange. I
wish there was some of the liquid left. I will see
the druggist who put it up. Possibly he can explain
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t put any on my shoulder,&rdquo;
said Phil. &ldquo;It would have been all up with
me and football, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly would,&rdquo; admitted Dr. Marshall.
&ldquo;Let me look at your dislocation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When can I get into the game again?&rdquo; asked
Phil anxiously, after the inspection.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! Well, I think by the middle of the
week. It is getting along better than I expected.
Yes, if you pad it well you may go into light practice
to-morrow, and play in a game the end of the
week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;Then&rsquo;s when we tackle
Fairview Institute for the first game of the season!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day a notice was posted on the bulletin
board in the gymnasium, stating that the &rsquo;varsity
eleven would line up against the scrub that afternoon
in secret practice. Then followed a list of
names of those selected to play on the first team.
It was as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah, Tom! You&rsquo;re at left-end!&rdquo; cried
Phil, who, with his chum, was reading the bulletin.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it. Are you all right for practice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. Come on; let&rsquo;s get into our togs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the outer fringe of football players stood
Langridge and Gerhart. There was surprise on
their faces at the sight of Phil getting ready to
play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something went wrong,&rdquo; whispered Langridge
to his crony. &ldquo;Your scheme didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see it didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; admitted Gerhart with a scowl.
&ldquo;I wonder where the slip was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when he heard of the peculiar ailment from
which Sid Henderson suffered, Gerhart knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lost that chance,&rdquo; he said to Langridge, &ldquo;but
I may see another to get square with Clinton, and,
when I do, I&rsquo;ll not fail. It&rsquo;s too late, maybe, for
me to get in the game now, but I&rsquo;ll put him out
of it, and don&rsquo;t you forget it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil was a little stiff in practice, but he soon
warmed up, and the &rsquo;varsity eleven played the
scrub &ldquo;all over the field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I like to see,&rdquo; complimented the
coach. &ldquo;Now, boys, play that way against Fairview
on Saturday, and you&rsquo;ll open the season with
a victory. I want you to win. Then we&rsquo;ll have
a better chance for the championship. The schedule
is different from the baseball one, you know.
We don&rsquo;t play so many games with Boxer Hall
and Fairview as we did in the spring, consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
each one counts more. Now I&rsquo;m going to give you
some individual instruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which the coach did very thoroughly, getting at
the weak spots in each man&rsquo;s playing, and commenting
wisely on it, at the same time showing
him how he ought to play his position. There
was practice in passing the ball, falling on it, kicking
and tackling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to do considerable work in the forward
pass and the on-side kick this season,&rdquo; the
coach went on. &ldquo;I think you are doing very well.
Parsons, don&rsquo;t forget to put all the speed you can
into your runs, when getting down on kicks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You Jersey twins don&rsquo;t want to be watching
each other so. I know you are fond of one another,
but try to forget that you are brothers, and
be more lively in the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jerry and Joe Jackson joined in the laugh that
followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for you, Snail Looper,&rdquo; continued Coach
Lighton, giving the center the name he had earned
from his habit of prowling about nights and moving
at slow speed, &ldquo;you are doing fairly well, but
be a little quicker. Try to forget that you&rsquo;re a
relative of the <i>Helix Mollusca</i>. You backs, get
into plays on the jump, and take advantage of the
momentum. That&rsquo;s the way to smash through the
line. Now then, we&rsquo;ll try signals again. Clinton,
keep a cool head. Nothing is worse than getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
your signals mixed, and you fellows, if you don&rsquo;t
understand exactly what the play is, call for the
signal to be repeated. That will save costly fumbles.
Now line up again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went through the remainder of the practice
with a snap and vim that did the heart of
the coach and the captain good. The scrub team
was pretty well worn out when a halt was called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think you will beat Fairview?&rdquo; asked
Ford Fenton of Tom a little later, when the left-end
and Phil were on their way to supper, after a
refreshing shower bath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so, Ford. But you never can tell. Football
is pretty much a gamble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so. But my uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, are you going to keep that up this term?&rdquo;
demanded Phil wearily. &ldquo;If you are, I&rsquo;m going
to apply to the courts for an injunction against
you and your uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Fenton with an injured air,
&ldquo;he was football coach here for some time, and
my uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he goes again!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Step on
him, Phil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ford, with a reproachful look, turned aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why there&rsquo;s such a prejudice against
my uncle,&rdquo; he murmured to himself. But there
wasn&rsquo;t. It was against the manner in which the
nephew ceaselessly harped on what his relative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
said, though Ford was never allowed to tell what
it was.</p>

<p>The Randall eleven was fairly on edge when
they indulged in light practice Saturday morning,
preparatory to leaving for Fairview, where the
first game of the season was to take place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feel fit, Tom?&rdquo; asked Sid, who had to carry
his left hand in a sling. Dr. Marshall had been
unable to learn anything from the druggist that
put up the liniment, and the cause for the queer
stiffness remained undiscovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As fit as a fiddle,&rdquo; replied the lad. &ldquo;How about
you, Phil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all to the Swiss cheese, as the poet had
it. Is it about time to start?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly. We&rsquo;re going in a special trolley.
Does your shoulder pain you any?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;er&mdash;your sister will
be at the game?&rdquo; ventured Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. She&rsquo;s as daffy about it as I am.
If she had been a boy she&rsquo;d have played. Miss
Tyler will be there, of course?&rdquo; Phil questioned
in turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I suppose so,&rdquo; answered Tom.
&ldquo;Oh, of course. She and your sister will probably
go together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re great chums. I wonder why I
didn&rsquo;t get a letter from dad to-day? He promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to write every night. I ought to have received
one. I&rsquo;d like to know how my mother is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no news is good news,&rdquo; quoted Tom.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start. I get nervous when I have to sit
around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a large crowd on the grandstand at
the Fairview gridiron when the Randall team arrived.
The seats were rapidly filling up, and when,
a little later, the visiting eleven trotted out for
practice, they were received with a burst of cheers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Randall?&rdquo; demanded
Bean Perkins, who had been christened &ldquo;Shouter&rdquo;
from the foghorn quality of his tones. He generally
led the college cheering and singing. Back
came the usual reply that nothing whatever ailed
Randall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good bunch out,&rdquo; observed Tom to
Phil as they passed the ball back and forth. &ldquo;Look
at the girls! My, what a lot of them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And all pretty, too,&rdquo; added Phil. &ldquo;At least, I
know one who is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Tyler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know another,&rdquo; spoke the left-end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your sister. She&rsquo;s prettier than the photograph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better tell her so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew! It doesn&rsquo;t take you long to get down
to business. But come on. They&rsquo;re going to line
up for practice,&rdquo; and the two ran over to join their
teammates.</p>

<p>What a mass of color the grandstands and
bleachers presented! Mingled with the youths and
men were girls and women in bright dresses, waving
brighter-hued flags. There were pretty girls
with long horns, tied with streamers of one college
or the other. There were more pretty girls with
long canes, from which flew ribbons of yellow and
maroon&mdash;Randall&rsquo;s colors. There were grave men
who wore tiny footballs on their coat lapels, a knot
of ribbon denoting with which college they sided.</p>

<p>Massed in one stand were the cheering students
of Randall, bent on making themselves heard above
the songs and yells of their rivals. Nor were the
girls of Fairview at all backward in giving vent to
their enthusiasm. They had songs and yells of
their own, and, under the leadership of Madge
Tyler, were making themselves heard.</p>

<p>Tom, in catching a long kick, ran close to the
stand where the Fairview girls were massed.
Madge was down in front, getting ready to lead
them in a song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; cried Tom to her, as he booted the
pigskin back to Ed Kerr.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry I can&rsquo;t cheer for you this time!&rdquo; called
Madge brightly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry we will have to push the Fairview
boys off the field,&rdquo; retorted Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you going to do that?&rdquo; asked a girl
behind Madge, and Tom, who had been vainly
looking for her, saw Ruth Clinton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but we have to,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t
you ashamed to cheer against your own brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess Phil is able to look after himself,&rdquo;
said Ruth. &ldquo;Is his shoulder all right, Mr. Parsons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doing nicely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then the referee&rsquo;s whistle blew to summon
the players from practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you after the game,&rdquo; called Tom, and
as he glanced from Ruth to Madge, he saw the
latter regarding him rather curiously from her
brown eyes. With a queer feeling about the region
where he imagined his heart to be, he ran across
the field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember&mdash;fast, snappy play!&rdquo; was the last
advice from Coach Lighton. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to
win, boys. Don&rsquo;t forget that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the stand where the Randall supporters
were gathered came that enthusing song&mdash;the song
they always sang at a big game&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Aut vincere aut
mori</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Either we conquer or we die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep cool and smash through &rsquo;em,&rdquo; spoke Captain
Cross to his players, as the referee and other
officials took their places.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Fairview&rsquo;s kick-off, and a moment later
the ball came sailing through the air. Holly Cross
caught it, and, well protected by interference, began
to rush it back. But the Fairview players, by
amazing good play, managed to get through, and
Holly was downed after a run back of twenty
yards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, all together!&rdquo; called Phil, as he
eagerly got into place behind big Snail Looper, who
was bending over the ball. Then the quarter-back
rattled off a string of signals for Jerry Jackson,
the left half-back, to take the ball through the
opposing left tackle and end.</p>

<p>Back came the ball, accurately snapped by the
center. Jerry Jackson was on the alert and took
it from Phil as he passed him on the run. Kindlings
Woodhouse smashed in to make a hole for
his brother back, who closely followed. Captain
Cross, on the jump, took care of the opposing left-end,
and with a crash that was heard on the grandstand,
one of the Jersey twins hit the line. The
game was fairly begun.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<h3>SMASHING THE LINE</h3>


<p>&ldquo;First down!&rdquo; came the encouraging cry, when
the mass of players had become disentangled, and
Jerry Jackson was seen to still have possession of
the ball. He had made a great gain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, once more, fellows!&rdquo; called Phil.
&ldquo;Smash the line to pieces!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again there came a play, this time with Holly
Cross endeavoring to go between center and
guard. But, unexpectedly, he felt as if he had hit
a stone wall. Fairview had developed unusual
strength. There was no gain there. But Phil
thought he knew the weakness of the opposing
team, and he decided for another try at line bucking.
There would still be time for kicking on the
third down, and he wanted his team to have the
ball as long as possible early in the game.</p>

<p>This time he signaled for Dutch Housenlager,
who was at right tackle, to go through left tackle.
The play was well executed, but Dutch was a little
slow at hitting the line, and after a slight advance
he was held, and only five yards were gained. Randall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
must kick, and the yells of delight that had
greeted her first advance were silenced, while the
supporters of the co-educational academy prepared
to encourage their players by vocal efforts.</p>

<p>Holly Cross booted the ball well up into the
enemy&rsquo;s territory. Tom, and Joe Jackson, the
ends, were down like tigers, but they could not
break through the well-organized interference that
surrounded Roger Barnes, the Fairview full-back.
On he rushed until Phil, pluckily breaking through,
tackled him fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now see how we can hold &rsquo;em!&rdquo; called Holly
Cross to his men, and they all braced, ready for
the smash they knew would come. Nor was it long
delayed. Right at the center of the line came
Lem Sellig, the Fairview left half-back. But he
met Snail Looper&rsquo;s solid flesh, supported by Phil
and the three other backs. Yet, in spite of this,
Lem managed to advance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold! hold!&rdquo; pleaded Holly, and, with gritting
teeth and tense muscles, his men did hold.
But ten yards had been gained. Fairview was not
as easy as had been hoped.</p>

<p>Once more the line-smashing occurred, but this
time not for such a gain, and on the next try Fairview
was forced to kick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right down the line, now!&rdquo; called Phil, and,
as if the cheering contingent understood, Bean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Perkins, with his foghorn voice, started the song:
&ldquo;Take it to the Goal Posts, Boys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It had been decided, before the game, that Randall
would attempt only straight football, at least
during the first half. Coach Lighton wisely advised
against trick plays so early in the season, as
there were a number of comparatively new men on
the eleven. So Phil, when his side had the ball
again, called for more line-smashing, and his men
responded nobly.</p>

<p>They advanced the ball to the twenty-five yard
line, and, though tempted to give the signal for a
goal from the field, Phil refrained, as there was
a quartering wind blowing. He did signal for a
fake kick play, however, feeling that he was justified
in it, and to his horror there was a fumble.
Fairview broke through and captured the ball.</p>

<p>Dejected and almost humiliated, Randall lined
up to receive a smashing attack, but instead Fairview
kicked, for her captain was nervous, and
feared the holding powers of his opponent&rsquo;s line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em!&rdquo; yelled Phil, as Holly
Cross began running back with the pigskin. The
Fairview ends were right on hand, however, and
broke through the interference, so that Holly was
downed ere he had covered ten yards. But it gave
Randall the ball, and then, with a grim determination
to smash or be smashed, the lads went at
the Fairview line hammer and tongs. They rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the ball to the ten-yard line this time, and then
came a rapid succession of sequence plays, no signals
being given. Indeed, had Phil yelled the
numbers and letters through a megaphone, they
could hardly have been heard, so tumultuous was
the cheering of the Randall supporters.</p>

<p>Against such whirlwind playing as this the Fairview
line crumpled and went to pieces. Slam-bang
at it came first Holly Cross, then Kindlings, and
then Jerry Jackson. The latter, by a great effort,
managed to wiggle along the last few inches, and
placed the ball over the final white mark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Touch-down!&rdquo; yelled Tom Parsons, and a
touch-down it was. How the cheers broke forth
then! What a riot of color from the grandstands!
How the flags, ribbons and banners waved! How
the gay youths and grave men yelled themselves
hoarse! How the girls&rsquo; shrill voices sounded over
the field!</p>

<p>The goal was missed on account of the strong
wind, and once more the play started in. There
was more line-smashing and some kicking, yet the
half ended with the score five to nothing in favor
of Randall.</p>

<p>There was much talk in the dressing-room of the
Randall players during the intermission. Some of
the players pleaded for the trial of trick plays
which they had practiced, but Coach Lighton insisted
on line-smashing.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it is more tiresome,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it
will be better practice for you now. You need
straight football early in the season. Clinton, how
is your shoulder holding out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt me at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As only minor hurts had resulted from the play
of the first half, no change was made in the line-up.
Once more, when the whistle blew, did the
whirlwind work begin. There was a noticeable
difference in the style of Fairview. They had put
in some new men, and were playing a kicking game.
They were holding better in the line, too.</p>

<p>The result was that after several minutes of
play, during which the ball had changed hands
several times, the Randall players were tiring. It
was what the wily captain of the Fairview team
had counted on. Then he sent his men smashing
the line, and to the grief of Holly Cross he saw
his men being pushed back. In vain did he appeal
to them&mdash;even reviled them&mdash;for not holding their
ground. But it was impossible, and, following a
sensational run around right end, Joe Jackson missing
an easy tackle of Lem Sellig, the latter player
made a touch-down. This time it was the chance
for the Fairview supporters to cheer and yell,
and they did it, the singing contingent rendering
with much effect: &ldquo;We Have Old Randall&rsquo;s Scalp
Now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The score was tied, as Fairview failed to kick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
goal, and at it they went again, smash and hammer,
hammer and smash. Phil called for a trick play,
and it worked well, but the gain was small, and a
little later the ball went to Fairview on a penalty.
Then came the surprise of the day. On a forward
pass the pigskin was taken well toward Randall&rsquo;s
goal line, and after the down Ted Puder, the husky
left-tackle, was shoved over for another touch-down.</p>

<p>The stands fairly trembled under the cheers,
yells and excited stamping of the co-educationals.
The girls sang a song of victory, and the Randall
players, with woe-begone faces, gathered behind
their goal posts. There was a futile attempt to
block the kick, but the spheroid sailed over the
bar. The score was eleven to five against Randall.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<h3>&ldquo;GIRLS ARE QUEER&rdquo;</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows, we can win, or at least tie the
score yet,&rdquo; remarked Captain Cross, as his players
were sent back to the middle of the field for another
kick-off. &ldquo;Smash through &rsquo;em! Phil, try our forward
pass and on-side kick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are only five minutes more of play,&rdquo;
said Tom, who heard that from the timekeeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, we can do it. Tie the score, anyhow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was not to be. Smash through the line
though her players did, for there seemed no stopping
them, successful as the forward pass was,
and with the gain netted by an on-side kick, Randall
could do no better than to carry the ball to
the Fairview ten-yard line.</p>

<p>There might have been a try for a field goal, but
Phil decided there was no chance for it, whereas
bucking the line was almost a sure thing. His
men were doing magnificent work, for they had carried
the ball continuously from the middle of the
field without loss. Two minutes more of play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
would have given them a touch-down, but the fatal
whistle blew, and with a groan the Randall players
knew their last hope was gone.</p>

<p>There came the usual cheers and college yells for
the vanquished from the victors, and the return
of the compliment. Then the downcast Randall
lads filed slowly across the gridiron. They were
sad at heart, and Coach Lighton noticed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows, you did magnificent work!&rdquo; he exclaimed
enthusiastically. &ldquo;You really did!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All except winning,&rdquo; said Tom gloomily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we played rotten!&rdquo; burst out Phil, who
seemed to take it much to heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I let Sellig get around me, and missed
tackling him,&rdquo; said Joe Jackson, fairly groaning.
&ldquo;That cost us the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Cross, who
knew the danger of despondency. &ldquo;You did all
right, Joe; and the other Jersey twin shone like
a star on a dark night. We&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, except for what ails us,&rdquo; added Dutch
Housenlager, making a playful attempt to trip up
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Quit that!&rdquo; exclaimed the left-end in
no gentle voice.</p>

<p>Coach Lighton noticed it. Tom, as well as the
others, was &ldquo;on edge.&rdquo; It would not need much
more to demoralize the team. He must stop the
growing feeling.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re all right! I
know what I&rsquo;m talking about. I&rsquo;ve coached teams
before, and I say that for the first game of the
season you did all that could be expected. I&rsquo;m
proud of you. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thing like this happened once before,&rdquo; said
a voice at the elbow of the coach. &ldquo;My uncle
says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ford Fenton got no further, for Dutch
Housenlager, putting out his foot, neatly tripped
the offending one, and the rest of his sentence was
mumbled to the grass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serves him right!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, and in the
laugh that followed the nervous, disappointed feeling
of the team, in a measure, passed off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fairview has a good team,&rdquo; went on Coach
Lighton. &ldquo;I give them credit for that. But we
have a better one, and now that we know their
style of play and their weakness we can beat them
next game. We&rsquo;ll have another chance at them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll wipe up the gridiron with &rsquo;em!&rdquo; cried
Holly Cross. &ldquo;Forget it, fellows! Let&rsquo;s sing
&lsquo;Marching to the Goal Posts,&rsquo;&rdquo; which they did
with such a vim that the spirits of all were raised
many degrees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Phil,&rdquo; remarked Tom, as he was getting
off his football togs, &ldquo;we were sort of up against
it, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it might have been worse. But the way the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
fellows rushed the ball up the field the last five minutes
was a caution. It was like a machine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; we ought to have done that first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. By the way, I&rsquo;m going to see
my sister. Want to come along?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom with such eagerness that
Phil remarked dryly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that she&rsquo;ll be with Madge Tyler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Tom
hastily, and he swallowed quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Phil.</p>

<p>They finished dressing, and went across the field
to where a crowd of spectators was still congregated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think you can find her in this bunch?&rdquo; asked
Tom, but he was taking no chances, for he himself
was keeping a sharp lookout for a certain fair
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess so. If I don&rsquo;t spot her she&rsquo;ll
glimpse me. Girls are great for finding people in
a crowd. Sis always seems to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Phil!&rdquo; called a voice a moment later, and
Ruth Clinton hurried up to her brother, gaily waving
a Fairview flag. She was followed by Madge
Tyler, who also had her college colors with her.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your shoulder?&rdquo; asked Ruth anxiously.
&ldquo;I was so nervous that I couldn&rsquo;t bear to look at
the plays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ve got a lot of ruffians on your team,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
retorted her brother. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know how to
play like gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they know how to win!&rdquo; exclaimed Madge,
as she greeted her chum&rsquo;s brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; admitted Phil, making a rueful
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I had to cheer against you and Mr.
Parsons to-day,&rdquo; went on Madge, as she looked at
Phil. &ldquo;I really&mdash;well, of course I can&rsquo;t say I
really wanted to you to win against Fairview, but
I wish the score had been even.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no satisfaction in that,&rdquo; retorted Tom.
&ldquo;We lost, and they won, fairly and squarely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m glad you admit that,&rdquo; spoke Ruth with
a laugh, and she waved her flag in Tom&rsquo;s face.
He made a grab for it, and caught the end of the
cane. For an instant he stood thus, looking into
the laughing, mischievous eyes of Ruth Clinton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want it?&rdquo; she asked daringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;even though it is the color
of the enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you give me for it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My colors,&rdquo; said Tom, taking a small knot of
yellow and maroon from his coat lapel. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
exchange until the victory goes the other way
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she agreed laughingly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget,
now. Mr. Parsons.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not,&rdquo; he assured her, and he turned to see
Madge regarding him curiously. Her eyes shifted
away quickly as they met his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heard from dad?&rdquo; asked Phil, who had been
an amused witness to the little scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have a letter with me,&rdquo; answered his
sister. &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; and she handed it to Phil.
&ldquo;Mother is some better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Do you have to get right back
to college, or have you girls time to go down
the street and have some soda?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll make time to go with <i>you</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed
Madge, and she accented the last word.
Tom looked at her keenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; invited Phil, and, as if it was
the most natural thing in the world, he swung
alongside of Madge, leaving Tom to walk with
Ruth. Nor was Tom at all slow to take advantage
of this arrangement, though for a brief instant
he hardly knew whether or not he ought to
go with her, considering how friendly Madge had
been with him since she gave up going with Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does it feel to lose?&rdquo; asked Ruth, as she
walked with Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not very good,&rdquo; he answered, as he listened to
Madge&rsquo;s gay laugh at something Phil said. He
was reflecting how well she got along with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
handsome quarter-back. But Tom was not unaware
of the charms of the pretty girl at his side. They
talked on many subjects during the walk to town,
and Tom felt like a chap who has had offered to
him the choice of two most delightful companions,
and cannot tell which one he likes best. Ruth was
certainly an attractive girl, and her jolly laugh&mdash;but
just then he heard the rippling tones of
Madge&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang it all!&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;What
am I up against?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They spent a jolly afternoon before it was time
for Tom and Phil to start back to Randall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll come over again&mdash;soon,&rdquo; said
Ruth to her brother as they were about to part.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, if Miss Tyler will second your invitation,&rdquo;
replied Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; said Madge heartily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I come, too?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Ruth promptly. &ldquo;I shall
expect you to report to me on the condition of my
colors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; was Tom&rsquo;s remark. Then he
waited for Madge to say something to him, but
she turned away without a word. Yet Tom could
not forget that she had added her invitation to that
of Ruth in regard to Phil.</p>

<p>Whereat, wondering over some matters on the
way home, Tom said to his chum:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls are queer, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you just finding that out?&rdquo; asked the
quarter-back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; was what Tom said.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<h3>PHIL SAVES WALLOPS</h3>


<p>They were talking the game over in their room&mdash;Phil,
Sid and Tom. Sid, from the effects of the
strong liquid which Gerhart had substituted for
the liniment, still had to carry his hand in a sling,
but the fingers were slowly losing their stiffness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you fellows made a mistake,&rdquo; Sid was
saying, as he moved about on the creaking old sofa
to get into a more comfortable position, &ldquo;where
you fellows made a mistake was in not doing more
kicking early in the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose you could have run things better
than Phil did?&rdquo; suggested Tom, not altogether
pleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not better, but different. You should have
tired them out, and then smashed their line all to
pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t altogether such easy smashing as you
would suppose, sitting and watching the game from
the grandstand, was it, Tom?&rdquo; came from Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; responded the left-end, as he
rubbed his shoulder, which he had bruised making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
a hard tackle. &ldquo;They were as tough as nails. I
suppose we did fairly well, considering everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All but winning,&rdquo; spoke Sid drowsily. &ldquo;You
didn&rsquo;t do that, you know. Now be fair; did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, cut it out, you old would-be philosopher!&rdquo;
cried Phil, twisting around in the easy chair to
reach something to throw at his chum. All he
could find was a newspaper, and he doubled that
up. It missed Sid, and hitting an ink bottle on
the mantle, broke the phial, the black fluid flowing
down over the wall and on the carpet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice thing to do!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Say,
what do you want to make a rough house for?
Isn&rsquo;t this den bad enough as it is, without you
doing that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; answered Phil contritely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at the rug!&rdquo; went on Tom, as the ink
formed a black pool. &ldquo;Pretty, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the pattern changed if we keep on,&rdquo;
murmured Sid, without opening his eyes. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
the liniment spot, now the ink spot, and the grease
spots left by the former occupants. Maybe we
ought to get a new rug, fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not this term,&rdquo; said Tom emphatically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
run over my money as it is, and I don&rsquo;t like to ask
dad for more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I notice you had some to spend for flowers to-night,&rdquo;
remarked Phil.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>On the way home from the game Tom had
stopped in a florist&rsquo;s in Fairview and given an
order, while Phil remained outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that Tom has been
sending flowers to some girl?&rdquo; demanded Sid, sitting
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you can draw your own conclusions,&rdquo;
replied Phil. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t bring &rsquo;em home to decorate
<i>our</i> room, that&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse and some more, too,&rdquo; murmured Sid.
&ldquo;What are you coming to, Tom?&rdquo; He looked reproachfully
at his chum. Then he shook his head.
&ldquo;This girl business!&rdquo; he spluttered. Then, as his
eyes gazed about the room, he caught sight of the
little flag of Fairview colors which Ruth Clinton
had given Tom. The latter had placed it partly
behind a picture of a football game. &ldquo;Where did
that come from?&rdquo; demanded Sid, getting up from
the couch with an effort and striding over to the
offending emblem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo; declared Tom. &ldquo;Ruth&mdash;I mean
Phil&rsquo;s sister&mdash;gave it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For an instant Sid looked at his chum. Then
his gaze traveled to the picture of the girl&mdash;the
two girls&mdash;for that of Madge was beside the likeness
of Ruth&mdash;and the former first-baseman
sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose there&rsquo;s no hope for
it, but I wish I&rsquo;d gone in with some fellows who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
weren&rsquo;t crazy on the girl question. First thing I
know you fellows will have this a regular boudoir;
and then where will I be? I expect any day now
you&rsquo;ll be wanting to get rid of this old couch and
chair, and get some mission furniture, so that you
can have a five o&rsquo;clock tea here, and invite some
girls and chaperons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we do?&rdquo; asked Phil, who for some
reason sided with Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all I&rsquo;ve got to say is that I give up,&rdquo;
and Sid, with a helpless look, flung himself down
on the sofa and turned his back on his chums.
&ldquo;Next you know you&rsquo;ll be playing tennis or croquet
instead of football. You make me sick! I tell you
what it is, if you put any more of those tomfool
decorations, like flags and photographs, in this
room, I&rsquo;m going to quit!&rdquo; and Sid spoke earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, forget it, you old misanthropic specimen
of a misogynist!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil with a laugh.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be there yourself some day, and then you&rsquo;ll
see how it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you talk as if you had a girl, too!&rdquo; cried
Sid, sitting up again and looking fixedly at Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I have,&rdquo; was the noncommittal answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve gone back on me, too,&rdquo; was what
Sid said, as he pretended to go to sleep.</p>

<p>It was quiet in the room for a while, each lad
busy with his thoughts. Who shall say what they
were? One thing is certain&mdash;that the gazes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Tom and Phil often traveled to the wall on which
were the photographs of two girls&mdash;Madge and
Ruth. Tom looked at both; but Phil&mdash;well, did
you ever know a fellow, no matter how nice a sister
he had, to care to steal surreptitious glances at her
picture? Did you? Well, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m going to
say now.</p>

<p>The fussy little alarm clock ticked monotonously
on, as if anxious to get its work done. Still neither
of the three chums spoke. Occasionally Sid would
shift his position, but he did not open his eyes.
Tom sometimes looked at the liniment stain in
the carpet, and then at the ink spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder you wouldn&rsquo;t get a blotter and
sop up some of that writing fluid,&rdquo; suggested Phil
to Tom at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do it yourself?&rdquo; was the retort.
&ldquo;You knocked it over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too comfortable,&rdquo; murmured Phil from the
depths of the chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Tom. Then there was
silence once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your hand, Sid?&rdquo; asked Tom, when the
clock had ticked off what seemed to the lads about
a million strokes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little better. That&rsquo;s the worst thing I ever
had happen to me,&rdquo; and Sid looked at his stiffened
fingers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you fellows are going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to do, but I&rsquo;m going to bed!&rdquo; he suddenly exclaimed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sleepy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on out and take a walk,&rdquo; proposed Tom
to Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stiff and lame. Maybe I can walk
it off. Then we&rsquo;ll take a hot bath in the gym and
turn in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds good,&rdquo; agreed Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They left Sid undressing and went out, it not
being a proscribed hour. After a brisk walk around
the campus they started for the gymnasium. As
they neared it they heard voices coming from the
direction of Biology Hall, a small building situated
to the right of their dormitory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, then, hold him, Gerhart, while I clip
him two or three good ones!&rdquo; they heard some one
say, and immediately after that came in pleading
tones:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t hit me again, Mr. Langridge.
I did the best I could for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best, you little rat! You didn&rsquo;t get the
stuff I sent you for!&rdquo; exclaimed Langridge angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because they wouldn&rsquo;t sell me the whisky,&rdquo;
was the answer. &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Langridge, please don&rsquo;t
hit me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Wallops!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. &ldquo;Wallops, the
little messenger. What&rsquo;s that brute Langridge
up to now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems as if he sent Wallops after liquor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
he didn&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I hear he&rsquo;s been
up to that trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dirty cad!&rdquo; whispered Phil.</p>

<p>A moment later there was the sound of a blow,
and it was followed by a cry of pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; cried Phil to Tom, and the two
strode around the corner of the building. They
saw Gerhart holding Wallops, who was a lad small
for his age, while Langridge was punching him in
the face, accompanying each blow with the remark:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will teach you to play the sneak trick on
me. You drank that stuff yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the messenger. &ldquo;They
wouldn&rsquo;t let me have it. There was a new man
behind the bar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a likely story. Hold him tight, Gerhart;
I&rsquo;m going to paste him another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hound!&rdquo; cried Phil, his voice shrill with
rage, and an instant later he had fairly leaped
beside the bully. With one hand he thrust Langridge
aside, and then, with a straight left on the
jaw, he sent him to the ground with a thud.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<h3>PHIL IS NERVOUS</h3>


<p>Langridge struggled to his feet, anger rendering
him almost speechless. He started toward
Phil, who stood in the attitude of a trained boxer,
awaiting the attack. The light from a new moon
faintly illuminated the scene, and the figures stood
out with considerable distinctness against the background
of the dark building.</p>

<p>Wallops, the messenger, was shrinking away,
anxious to escape unobserved, though he cast a look
of gratitude at Phil. Tom was surprised at his
chum&rsquo;s sudden attack, but he stood ready to aid
him, in case Gerhart should make an effort to take
sides. As for Phil and Langridge, they faced each
other, one eager with righteous anger to continue
the chastisement, the other mad with the lust of
shame and unreasoning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what did you do that for?&rdquo; asked
Langridge thickly, and his hand went to his jaw
where Phil&rsquo;s fist had landed. His head was singing
yet from the powerful blow.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You know why,&rdquo; replied Phil calmly. &ldquo;Because
you&rsquo;re a coward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried the bully, taking a step forward.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stood about all I&rsquo;m going to from
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked around at Gerhart. The freshman
stood passive, and Langridge showed some surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to stand by me?&rdquo; asked the
sophomore of his ally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; muttered Gerhart, but there was
no heart in his tones. He remembered what his
crony had said regarding Phil&rsquo;s prowess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; put in Tom with gentle voice.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make a quartet of it, if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you interfering with my affairs for?&rdquo;
went on Langridge, taking no notice of Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s the affair of any decent college man
to interfere when he catches a dirty coward beating
a fellow smaller than he is!&rdquo; and Phil fairly
bit off the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; cried Langridge. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going
too far. I&rsquo;ll make a class matter of it if you call
me a coward again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would!&rdquo; burst out Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to make a charge against you before the whole
college! Beating Wallops because he&rsquo;s smaller
than you are!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t it. He didn&rsquo;t do as I told him,
and was insolent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who gave you the right to assume a mastery
over him? Besides, from what I heard, you had
evidently ordered him to do something against
the rules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! So you were sneaking around to listen,
were you?&rdquo; sneered Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know better than that, or I&rsquo;d answer you
in the same way I did at first,&rdquo; replied Phil. &ldquo;If
you send Wallops for liquor again I shall inform
Dr. Churchill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always thought you were a tattling cad!&rdquo;
burst out Langridge. &ldquo;Now I know it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardly were the words out of his mouth ere
Phil was beside him. The quarter-back was fairly
trembling, and his voice shook as he shot out the
words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take that back! Take it back, I say, or&mdash;or
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused, emotion overcoming him, but from
the manner in which he drew back his powerful
left arm Langridge stepped aside apprehensively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you haven&rsquo;t any right to interfere in
my affairs,&rdquo; he whined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you take back what you said?&rdquo; demanded
Phil fiercely, and he laid a trembling hand on the
shoulder of the bully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take your hand from me!&rdquo; exclaimed Langridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I suppose I&rsquo;ve got to&mdash;I can&rsquo;t fight
a professional pugilist,&rdquo; he added with an uneasy
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the compliment,&rdquo; spoke Phil grimly.
&ldquo;I guess this can end where it is. As for you,
Gerhart, if I thought you had any other part in
this than being a tool of this coward, I&rsquo;d give you
the soundest thrashing you ever had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The freshman did not answer, and when Langridge
turned aside Gerhart followed him into the
shadows. Poor Wallops waited until they were
out of sight, then the messenger trailed after Phil
and Tom. On the way he haltingly told the
chums that Langridge had been in the habit of
sending him to town to purchase stimulants for
him. It had come to the point where that night
where the bartender had refused to sell any more
liquor, warning having been given that sales to
minors were becoming too frequent. It was the
failure of Wallops to return with the whisky that
angered Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything about this, Wallops,&rdquo; advised
Phil. &ldquo;Langridge won&rsquo;t bother you again.
If he does, let me know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, and thank you, Mr. Clinton. I&rsquo;ll
not tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess Langridge and Gerhart won&rsquo;t, either,&rdquo;
commented Tom. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be glad to let it drop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What cads those fellows are,&rdquo; remarked Phil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
a little later, when he and Tom, having had a
refreshing shower bath, were preparing for bed
in their room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you took some of it out of Langridge,
at all events,&rdquo; said the pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe, but it will come back. I suppose I&rsquo;ll
have to be on the lookout now, or he may do me
a dirty turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. I had my troubles with
him last term. But I thought he was going to
do better this season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t seem to, evidently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; exclaimed Sid, poking his head from
beneath the sheet, &ldquo;I wish you fellows would let a
chap sleep. What are you chinning about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They told him, and, wide awake, he sat up and
listened to the whole story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d seen it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It would have
been as good as a football game. By the way, who
does the team play this week, Phil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve got a little game with the Haddonfield
Prep. School. Doesn&rsquo;t amount to much.
Some of the subs will play, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope Holly doesn&rsquo;t make the mistake of
despising an enemy,&rdquo; went on Sid. &ldquo;Do you know,
Phil, it seems to me that our fellows haven&rsquo;t struck
their gait yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s early in the season,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; went on Sid, &ldquo;but they ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
have more vim. There&rsquo;s a curious lack of ginger
noticed. <i>You</i> didn&rsquo;t play with your usual snap,
Phil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; was the almost unexpected answer
from the quarter-back. &ldquo;I wondered if any one
noticed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; added Tom, &ldquo;but I wasn&rsquo;t going to
say anything. I thought it was because it was
the first game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Phil slowly, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t that. I&rsquo;m
all unstrung&mdash;nervous&mdash;that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You nervous!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
have believed that. What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my mother,&rdquo; said Phil quietly, and there
was a strange tone in his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;she&rsquo;s not worse&mdash;is she?&rdquo; asked Tom,
and the room became curiously quiet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Phil; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t tell what
moment she may be. Fellows, I&rsquo;m living in constant
fear of receiving a message that&mdash;that she&mdash;that
she&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

<h3>THE SOPHOMORES LOSE</h3>


<p>There are several occasions when a young man
can find no words in which to express himself.
One is when he meets a pretty girl for the first
time, and another is when his best chum has a great
sorrow. There are other occasions, but these are
the chief ones. Thus it was with Tom and Sid.
For a few seconds after Phil&rsquo;s announcement they
sat staring at the floor. Their eyes took in the pattern
of the faded rug, though little of the original
figure was to be seen because of the many spots.
Then Tom looked about the apartment, viewing
the photographs of the two pretty girls, the sporting
implements massed in a corner, the table, with
its artistic confusion of books and papers. From
these his gaze traveled back to Phil.</p>

<p>As for Sid, he breathed heavily. If he had been
a girl I would have said that he sighed. Then,
being a youth who did not shirk any duty, no matter
how hard, Sid asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is she any worse, Phil? Have you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
bad news? Can&rsquo;t we&mdash;can&rsquo;t you go down where
she is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no specially bad news,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s this way: She has a malady which, sooner or
later, unless it is conquered, will&mdash;will take her
away from me&mdash;and sis. Dad thinks an operation
is the only hope, but they keep putting it off
from time to time, on a slim chance that she may
recover without it. For the operation is a desperate
expedient at best. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not
myself. That&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t go into the games
with all my might. I expect any moment to be
summoned to the sidelines to get a telegram saying&mdash;saying&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He choked up, and could not finish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it&mdash;is it as bad as that?&rdquo; asked Tom huskily,
and he put his arm over Phil&rsquo;s shoulder, as his
chum sat in the old easy chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty bad,&rdquo; said Phil softly. Then, with
a sudden change of manner, he exclaimed: &ldquo;But
say, I didn&rsquo;t mean to tell you fellows that. I don&rsquo;t
believe in relating my troubles to every one,&rdquo; and
he smiled, though it was not like his usual cheery
face that looked at his two chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now!&rdquo; cried Sid. &ldquo;As if we didn&rsquo;t
want to hear! And as if you shouldn&rsquo;t tell us your
troubles! Why, I expect to tell you fellows mine,
and I want to hear yours in return, eh, Tom.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the pitcher heartily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s mighty white of you chaps,&rdquo; went
on Phil, swallowing a lump in his throat. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;m not going to bother you any more, just now.
Only that&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;m&mdash;well, that I can&rsquo;t play
as I want to play. But I&rsquo;m going to try to forget
it. I&rsquo;m going into the next game, and help rip
their line to pieces. I&rsquo;m going to pilot our fellows
to a big score or dislocate my other shoulder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Sid. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s get to bed. It&rsquo;s
almost morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little talk among the three chums was productive
of good. There was a closer bond of
union among them than there had ever been before.
They felt more like brothers, and Tom and
Sid watched Phil for the next few days as if he
was a little chap, over whom they had been given
charge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, say!&rdquo; the quarter-back exclaimed at length
one afternoon, when they had followed him to
football practice, and walked home with him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not so bad as all that, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear any news to-day?&rdquo; asked Tom,
ignoring the mild rebuke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Got a telegram from dad. Things look
a little brighter, and yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to think too
much about it. We play Haddonfield to-morrow.
I want to wipe up the gridiron with them.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Which Phil and his chums pretty nearly did.
Haddonfield Preparatory School had the best
eleven in years, but, even with a number of scrub
players on Randall, the score was forty-six to nothing.
There was a different air about the college
team as the lads went singing from the field that
afternoon. There was confidence in their eyes.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful afternoon in October. Lectures
were over and a throng of students had
strolled over the campus and down to the banks
of Sunny River. The stream flowed lazily along
toward Lake Tonoka, winding in and out, as
though it had all the time it desired in which to
make the journey, and meant to take the full allowance.
There was nothing rapid or fussy about
Sunny River. It was not one of those hurrying,
bubbling, frothy streams that make a great ado
about going somewhere, and never arrive. There
was something soothing in walking along the banks
that bracing, fall day. There was just enough
snap in the air to prevent one from feeling enervated,
yet there was hardly a hint of winter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it make you feel as if you could stretch
out on your back and look up into the sky?&rdquo; asked
Phil of Tom as the three chums walked along.
Tom and the quarter-back had been to football
practice, and still had their togs on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now hold on!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid, before Tom
could answer. &ldquo;Is this going to lead anywhere?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that poetical start on a talk-fest. Are
you going to ring in beautiful scenery, calm, peaceful
atmosphere, a sense of loneliness, and then
switch off on to girls? Is that what you&rsquo;re driving
at? Because if it is I want to know, and I&rsquo;m going
back and read some psychology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re up the wrong tree,&rdquo; declared Tom. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what Phil means, but my answer to his
question would be that to stretch out on the ground
for any length of time at this season would mean
stiff muscles, not to mention rheumatism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fellows have no poetry in your nature,&rdquo;
complained Phil. &ldquo;Just look there, where the
river curves, how the trees lean over to be kissed
by the limpid water. Can&rsquo;t you fancy some one
floating, floating down it in a boat, with heart
attuned&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late for boating!&rdquo; exclaimed a voice
behind the trio. &ldquo;My uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil turned quickly and tried to grab Ford Fenton.
The youth with the uncle jumped back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; stammered
Fenton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matter!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;Why, you little shrimp,
I&rsquo;ve a good notion to chuck you into the river!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the river&mdash;the beautiful, meandering, poetical
river,&rdquo; added Tom. &ldquo;Quit it, Phil; you&rsquo;re
getting on my nerves. I&rsquo;m glad Fenton interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
you with a recollection of his uncle. What were
you going to say about your respected relative?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>But Fenton was going to take no chances with
Phil, and, turning about, he retraced his steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you saying, Phil?&rdquo; inquired Sid
politely, if sarcastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of your business,&rdquo; replied the quarter-back
a little stiffly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to write a poem
about it,&rdquo; he added more genially.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And send it to some girl, I suppose,&rdquo; went on
Sid. &ldquo;Oh, you make me sick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What further ramification the conversation might
have taken is problematical, but it was interrupted
just then by the arrival of Ed Kerr, who seemed
in much of a hurry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking all over for you fellows,&rdquo;
he panted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why hastenest thou thus so hastily?&rdquo; asked
Tom. &ldquo;Is the college on fire? Has Pitchfork
been taken with a fit, or has Moses sent to say we
need study no more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quit your gassin&rsquo;!&rdquo; ordered Ed. &ldquo;Say, we&rsquo;re
going to have the walk rush to-night. The freshies
have just had a meeting and decided on it. Tried
to pull it off quietly, but Snail Looper heard, and
kindly tipped us off. Dutch Housenlager is getting
the soph crowd together. You fellows want
to be in it, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;We have not
forgotten that we were once freshmen, and that
we had many clashes with the second-years. Now
we will play the latter rôle. Lead on, Macduff,
and he be hanged who first cries: &lsquo;Hold!
Enough!&rsquo; We&rsquo;ll make the freshies wish they had
never seen Randall College.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe&mdash;maybe not,&rdquo; spoke Phil. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a
husky lot&mdash;the first-year lads. But we can never
let them have the privilege of the walk without a
fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;walk rush,&rdquo; as it was termed, was one
of those matters about which college tradition had
centered. It was a contest between the freshman
and sophomore classes, that took place every fall,
usually early in October. It got its name from
the walk which circled Booker Memorial Chapel.
This chapel was the gift of a mother whose son
had died while attending Randall, and the beautiful
stained glass windows in it were well worth
looking at&mdash;in fact, many an artist came to Randall
expressly for that purpose.</p>

<p>Around the chapel was a broad walk, shaded
with stately oaks, and the path was the frequenting
place of the college lads. From time immemorial
the walk had been barred to freshmen
unless, in the annual rush, they succeeded in defeating
the sophomores, and, as this seldom occurred,
few freshmen used the walk, save on Sundays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
when all hostilities were suspended, in honor
of the day. The rush always took place on a small
knoll, or hill, back of the gymnasium, and it was
the object of the freshmen to take possession of
this point of vantage, and maintain it for half an
hour against the rush of the sophomores. If they
succeeded they were entitled to use the chapel walk.
If they did not, they were reviled, and any freshman
caught on the forbidden ground was liable to
summary punishment.</p>

<p>Dark figures stole silently here and there. Commands
and instructions were whispered hoarsely.
There was an air of mystery about, for it was the
night of the walk rush, and freshmen and sophomores
were each determined to win.</p>

<p>Garvey Gerhart, by virtue of the &ldquo;boosting&rdquo;
which Langridge had given him, had secured command
of the first-year forces. As soon as it was
dark he had assembled them on &ldquo;gym hill,&rdquo; as the
knoll was called. There was a large crowd of
freshmen, almost too large, it seemed, for the
sophomores were outnumbered two to one. But
Tom, Sid, Phil, Dutch Housenlager, Ed Kerr and
others of the second-year class were strong in the
belief of their power to oust their rivals from the
hilltop. They had a moral force back of them&mdash;the
conscious superiority of being &ldquo;veterans,&rdquo; which
counted for much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have our work cut out for us,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
commented Tom, as, with his chums advancing
slowly to the fray, he surveyed the throng of freshmen.
&ldquo;My, but there&rsquo;s a bunch of &rsquo;em! And
we&rsquo;ve got to clean every mother&rsquo;s son of them off
the hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; cried Phil gaily. &ldquo;It will be
good training for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; exclaimed Dutch, as he put out his
foot slyly to trip Sid. Tom saw the act, he executed
a quick movement that sent Housenlager
sprawling on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the time you got some of your own
medicine!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil with a laugh, as Dutch,
muttering dire vengeance, picked himself up.</p>

<p>The preliminaries for the rush were soon arranged,
timekeepers and umpires selected, and,
with the bright moon shining down on the scene,
the battle began. It was wild, rough and seemingly
without order, yet there was a plan about
it. The freshmen were massed together on top,
and about the center bunch were circles of their
fellows who were to thrust back the rushing sophomores.
Not until the last freshman had been swept
from the hill could the second-year youths claim
victory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready!&rdquo; yelled Ed Kerr, and at the freshmen
went their rivals.</p>

<p>There was the thud of body striking body.
Breaths came quick and fast. There were smothered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
exclamations, the sound of blows good-naturedly
taken and given. There were cries,
shouts, commands, entreaties. There was a swaying
of the mass, this way and that. A knot of
lads would go down, with a struggling pile on
top of them, and the conglomeration would writhe
about until it disentangled.</p>

<p>Tom, Phil and Sid (whose hand was now almost
entirely better) tore their way toward the center.
Time and again they were hurled back, only to
renew the rush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clean &rsquo;em off!&rdquo; was the rallying cry of the
sophomores.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fight &rsquo;em back!&rdquo; was the retort of the freshmen.</p>

<p>At it they went, fiercely and earnestly. The
entire mass appeared to be revolving about the
hill now, with the little group of freshmen on
the top as a pivot.</p>

<p>Gradually Tom, Phil and their particular chums
worked their way up to the crest. Then they found
that the freshmen had adopted strange tactics.
Under the advice of Gerhart they stretched out
prone, and, with arms and legs twined together,
made a regular layer of bodies, covering the summit.
It was almost impossible to separate the lads
one from the other, in order to hurl them out of
the way. They were literally &ldquo;sticking together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tear &rsquo;em apart!&rdquo; pleaded Tom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Rip &rsquo;em up!&rdquo; shouted Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold tight!&rdquo; sung out Gerhart.</p>

<p>And hang tightly they did. Tom succeeded in
breaking the hold of one lad, and Phil that of
another. But, in turn, the two big sophomores
were borne down and overwhelmed by the weight
of freshmen on their backs.</p>

<p>The referee blew a warning whistle. But two
minutes of time were left. The sophomores redoubled
their efforts, but the ruse of the freshmen
was a good one. It was like trying to tear apart
a living doormat.</p>

<p>The sophomores could not do it. Though they
labored like Trojans, it was not to be. Once more
the whistle blew, indicating that the rush was
ended.</p>

<p>The sophomores had lost, and for the remainder
of the term the freshmen could strut proudly about
the walk of Booker Memorial Chapel.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<h3>A FIRE ALARM</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Phil ruefully, as he and
Tom, rather sore and bruised, went to their room.
There was an air of quietness about the sophomores.
They did not cheer and sing, but back on
the knoll the victorious freshmen made the night
hideous with their college cries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; inquired Tom, for Phil had uttered
only the one word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, son, as Bricktop Molloy would
say. &lsquo;Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.&rsquo;
We were dumped good and proper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With plenty of gravy on the side,&rdquo; added Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid of it,&rdquo; spoke Tom solemnly. &ldquo;I
said they were too many for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to old &lsquo;I told you so,&rsquo;&rdquo; mocked Phil.
&ldquo;Next he&rsquo;ll be telling us that he predicted we&rsquo;d
lose the football championship. You make me
tired!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired already,&rdquo; retorted Tom good naturedly.
&ldquo;Some one gave me an extra good poke in
the ribs the last minute.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Gerhart,&rdquo; declared Sid. &ldquo;I saw him.
I had a good notion to punch him for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just as well you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; went on Tom.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no love lost between us and his crony,
Langridge, now. No use making matters worse.
But he certainly managed the freshies well. That
was a good trick, lying down and making a mat
of themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; hereafter I suppose it will be the regular
practice for future classes,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have to think up a new plan to break up that kind
of interference. My, but I&rsquo;m lame!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not let Lighton hear you say that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d lay you off from football. There are three
candidates for every position on the &rsquo;varsity this
term, and we fellows who have made the eleven
will have to take care of ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; admitted Tom. &ldquo;Well, a hot bath
will fix me up, and then for some good sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could snooze,&rdquo; spoke Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to bone away on Greek. Got turned
back in class to-day, and Pitchfork, who&rsquo;s a regular
fiend at it, as well at Latin, warned me that
I&rsquo;d be conditioned if I didn&rsquo;t look out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to be careful, son,&rdquo; cautioned Sid.
&ldquo;Remember how I nearly slumped in Latin before
the big ball game last year, and only just got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
through by the skin of my teeth in time to play?
Don&rsquo;t let that happen to you. It isn&rsquo;t good for
the constitution; not a little bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three chums went to the gymnasium and
had a warm shower, followed by a brisk rub-down,
after which they all felt better. Then, in their
room, they talked the walk rush all over again,
until Phil threw books at Sid and Tom to make
them keep quiet so that he might study.</p>

<p>The week that followed was marked by some
hard practice on the gridiron, for there was in
prospect a game with the Orswell Military
Academy, the eleven of which was seldom defeated.
Therefore, Coach Lighton and Captain Cross
worked their men well.</p>

<p>Phil, in particular, received some very special
instructions about running the team. Some new
plays were practiced, and a different sequence was
planned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want three corking good plays to be worked
in sequence when we get to within reaching distance
of the twenty-five-yard line,&rdquo; said the coach.
&ldquo;Maybe we can try for a field goal, but the chances
are against it if the wind blows. A good sequence
will do wonders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the coach explained the sequence plays.
They were to be three, in which the right-half, the
full-back and the left-tackle would successively take
the ball, without a word being spoken after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
first signal for the play had been given. The plays
were to be executed in quick succession, and the
coach depended on that to demoralize the cadet
eleven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll probably be such cheering when we
get to within twenty-five yards of their goal that
it will be hard to hear signals, anyhow,&rdquo; Mr.
Lighton went on. &ldquo;So memorize these plays carefully,
and we&rsquo;ll try to work them. When Clinton
remarks: &lsquo;We have twenty-five yards to go, fellows;
walk up together, now,&rsquo; that will be the signal for
the sequence plays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They tried them against the scrub, and did remarkably
well. Then came a day of hard work,
followed by some light practice, and a rest on the
afternoon preceding the game with the cadets.</p>

<p>There was a big attendance at the grounds,
which adjoined the military academy, about twenty
miles from Randall College. In their first half
the home eleven, by dint of trick plays and much
kicking, so wore out the Randallites that they
could not score, while Orswell made two touch-downs.
But it was different in the second half,
and after a touch-down gained by a brilliant run
on Tom&rsquo;s part, there came a second one, which resulted
from the sequence plays. Right through
the line in turn went Kindlings Woodhouse, Holly
Cross and Ed Kerr. The twenty-five yards were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
made in three minutes of play, and the score tied.
Then, by a skilful forward pass and some line
bucking, another touch-down was made, and then,
as if to cap the climax, Holly Cross kicked a beautiful
field goal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! Hold me from flying!&rdquo; cried Phil, as
he tried to hug the entire team after the referee&rsquo;s
whistle blew. His fellows had responded nobly
to the calls he made on them, and he had run the
team with a level head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys, I&rsquo;m proud of you,&rdquo; said the coach. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the biggest score against the Orswell cadets in
many a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And there was much rejoicing in Randall College
that night, so that Professor Tines felt called
upon to remonstrate to Dr. Churchill about the
noise the lads were making.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m not aware of any unusual noise; not
from here,&rdquo; spoke the venerable president, in his
comfortable study, with a book of Sanskrit on his
knee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could hear it if you went outside,&rdquo; said the
Latin teacher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, doubtless; but, you see, my dear professor,
I&rsquo;m not going outside,&rdquo; and Dr. Churchill
smiled benevolently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Tines, as he went
back to his apartments. &ldquo;If I had my way, football<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and all sports would be abolished. They are
a relic of barbarism!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was late when Phil and Tom got to their
room that night. They narrowly escaped being
caught by Mr. Snell, one of the proctor&rsquo;s scouts,
and dashed into their &ldquo;den&rdquo; at full speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you make less row?&rdquo; demanded Sid, who
was studying. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve put all the thoughts I had
on my essay out of my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serves you right for being a greasy dig!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tom. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you be a sport? You&rsquo;re
getting to be a regular hermit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want my degree,&rdquo; explained Sid, who was
studying as he had not thought of doing his first
term.</p>

<p>It was after midnight when Tom, who did not
sleep well on account of the excitement following
the football game, awoke with a start. Through
the glass transom over the door of the room he
saw a red glare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he jumped out of bed
and landed heavily in the middle of the apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Phil, sitting up. &ldquo;Is there
a telegram for me? Is there&mdash;is there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was at Tom&rsquo;s side, hardly awake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no telegram,&rdquo; answered Tom quickly
&ldquo;Looks like a fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He threw open the door. The corridor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
filled with clouds of lurid smoke which rolled in
great masses here and there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole place is ablaze!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Get
up, Sid!&rdquo; and he pulled the bedclothes from his
still sleeping chum.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<h3>THE FRESHMEN DANCE</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Here, quit!&rdquo; cried Sid, making an effort to
pull back the coverings on which Tom was yanking.
&ldquo;Let a fellow alone, can&rsquo;t you? Quit fooling!
This is no freshman&rsquo;s room!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out, you old duffer!&rdquo; yelled Phil. &ldquo;The
place is on fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s on the wire?&rdquo; asked Sid, thinking some
one had called him on the telephone. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care who it is. I&rsquo;m not going to answer this time
of night. I want to sleep. Tell &rsquo;em to call up
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire! Fire! Not wire!&rdquo; shouted Tom in his
ear, and this time Sid heard and was fully awake.
He caught a glimpse of the clouds of lurid smoke
pouring in from the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jumping Johnnie cake! I should say it was a
fire!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Come on, fellows, let&rsquo;s get some
of our stuff out! I want my football pictures,&rdquo;
and with that Sid rushed to the wall and yanked
down the only bit of ornamentation he cared for&mdash;a
lithograph of a Rugby scrimmage. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
he yelled, grabbing up a pile of his clothes from a
chair. &ldquo;This is all I want. Let the books and
other stuff go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the sofa! The chair!&rdquo; cried Tom, who
had peered out into the hall, only to jump back
again, gasping and choking. &ldquo;We can chuck them
out of the window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Can&rsquo;t hurt &rsquo;em much,&rdquo; added
Phil, who was getting into his trousers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grab hold, then. But wait until I button my
vest,&rdquo; ordered Tom, who was fumbling with the
garment, the only one he had grabbed up. He
had switched on the electric light, and the gleam
shone through a cloud of the reddish smoke.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with this blamed thing, anyhow?&rdquo;
he cried, as he fumbled in vain for the
buttons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it on backwards!&rdquo; cried Sid, who
had tossed his clothes out of the window, following
them with the picture, and was now ready to
help his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Jehosophat!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;So I have!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He yanked off the garment and tossed it into a
corner. Then, clad only in his pajamas, he started
to carry the old armchair to the window. It was
almost too much for him, and Sid came to his
aid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let that go, and get the sofa out first!&rdquo; cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Phil. &ldquo;The chair can fall on that. Say, listen
to the row!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Out in the corridor could be heard confused
shouts, and the sound of students running to and
fro. Every now and then some one would cry
&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; and the rush would be renewed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole place must be going!&rdquo; cried Sid.
&ldquo;Hurry up, Tom, shove it out! Maybe we can
save some other things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better save ourselves first!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil.
&ldquo;The stairs and halls are all ablaze!&rdquo; He came
back from a look into the corridor choking and
gasping. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to jump for it! Shove that
chair out, then the sofa, and pile the bedding on
top. That will make a place to land on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here she goes!&rdquo; shouted Tom, and he and Sid
shoved their precious old chair from the window.
It fell with a great crash to the ground, two stories
below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Broken to bits!&rdquo; said Tom with a groan.
&ldquo;Now for the sofa. There&rsquo;ll be nothing left of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had raised it to the window sill, after much
effort, and were balancing it there while recovering
their breaths. Their room was filled with the
heavy fumes of smoke, and the noise in the corridor
was increasing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her go!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;Lively, now, if we
want to get out alive!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>But just as the three chums were about to release
their hold on the sofa, Mr. Snell, one of the under-janitors
of the college, and a sort of scout or spy
of the proctor&rsquo;s, ran into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fire! There&rsquo;s no danger!&rdquo; he called.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t throw anything out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No fire?&rdquo; questioned Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Some of the students burned red fire in
the halls, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; went on Mr. Snell. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
no danger. The proctor sent me around to explain.
It&rsquo;s only some illuminating red fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom, Sid and Phil looked at each other, as they
stood at the window, holding their precious sofa.
The clouds of smoke were rolling away, and the
noise was lessening. Tom looked out of the casement,
and, in the semi-darkness below, saw the
chair they had thrown out. Just then, from below,
a crowd of freshmen, who had perpetrated the
trick, began singing &ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s Burning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom glanced at his chums. Then he uttered
one word:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stung!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good and proper!&rdquo; added Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By a nest of fresh hornets!&rdquo; commented Sid
wrathfully.</p>

<p>The scout withdrew. Phil looked at his trousers,
and then he began slowly to take them off.
Tom took one more look out of the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re jumping all over our chair,&rdquo; he said.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They are? The young imps!&rdquo; cried Sid.
&ldquo;Come on to the rescue! Get into some togs and
capture a few freshmen.&rdquo; Then, as he realized
that he had tossed his clothes out of the window,
he groaned. &ldquo;You fellows will have to go,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any duds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re parading around with your best go-to-meeting
suit,&rdquo; observed Phil. Sid groaned
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry, fellows, if you love me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a crowd of sophs after &rsquo;em now,&rdquo;
added Tom, and so it proved. The freshmen beat
a retreat, and some of our friends&rsquo; classmates
formed a guard around the things on the ground.</p>

<p>The three chums were not the only ones who had
tossed articles out of their windows in the moments
of excitement. Many possessions of the
sophomores were on the ground below, and, now
that the scare was over, they began collecting them.
Tom and Phil managed, with the help of some of
their classmates, to get Sid&rsquo;s garments and the
chair back to their room. The chair was in sad
shape, though, and Sid groaned in anguish as he
viewed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, quit!&rdquo; begged Phil, as he tossed Sid&rsquo;s
clothes on the bed. &ldquo;We can fix it up again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll never be the same,&rdquo; wailed Sid as he tried
it. &ldquo;There was a place that just fit my back, and
now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>He leaped up with a howl, and held his hand
to the fleshy part of his leg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A broken spring stuck me,&rdquo; explained Sid, who
was too lightly clad to indulge in indiscriminate
sitting about. &ldquo;Oh, those freshies! What can
we do to get square with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like it,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
to pay them back in some way, and the sooner the
better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an hour or more before matters had
quieted down in the west dormitory. From various
sophomores who came into their room to exchange
notes, Tom, Phil and Sid learned that the
freshmen had executed a well-organized fire scare
by the simple process of burning in each corridor
some of the powder extensively used on Fourth of
July, or in political parades.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no use talking about what they
did to us,&rdquo; said Ed Kerr. &ldquo;The question is, what
can we do to them? They certainly put it all over
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dutch, you ought to be able to suggest something,&rdquo;
said Tom. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always up to some
trick. Give us one to play on the freshies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Dutch. &ldquo;Let me think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid arose and turned out the light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; asked Dutch.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So you can think better. I can, in the dark.
Go ahead, now. Let&rsquo;s have something good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dutch was silent for a few minutes, and then
he proposed a plan which was received with exclamations
of delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very thing!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;I wonder we
didn&rsquo;t think of it before. We&rsquo;ll be just in time.
Now, maybe we can make them laugh on the other
side of their heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning there were triumphant looks
on the faces of the freshmen. They had played a
good joke on their traditional enemies, the sophomores,
and felt elated over it. But, in accordance
with a plan they had adopted the night after Dutch
revealed his plan, the sophomores made no retort
to the taunts of their enemies. And there was no
lack of railery. Gathered on the walk about Booker
Memorial Chapel, whence for many terms freshmen
had, by traditional college custom, been barred,
the first-year lads made all sorts of jokes concerning
the scrabble that had ensued among the sophomores
when the cry of fire was raised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we have to stand it!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom,
gritting his teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a couple of days,&rdquo; added Sid. &ldquo;But it
strikes me, old chap, that last term you played the
rôle of the aforesaid freshies to perfection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was different. But let them wait.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
We&rsquo;ll put the kibosh on their fun in a few days.
Has Dutch got the stuff?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. &ldquo;The least hint will
spoil the scheme of revenge! Revenge! Revenge!&rdquo;
he hissed, after the manner of a stage villain. &ldquo;We
will have our re-venge-e-e-e-e!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the night of the freshman dance, an annual
affair that loomed large in the annals of the
first-year students and their girl friends. It was
to be held in a hall in Haddonfield, and many
were the precautions taken by the committee to prevent
any of the hated sophomores from attending,
or getting to the place beforehand, lest they
might, by some untoward act, &ldquo;put it on the blink,&rdquo;
as Holly Cross used to say.</p>

<p>The hall was tastefully arranged with flowers
and a bank of palms, behind which the orchestra
was to be hidden. About the balcony were draped
the college colors, with the class hues of the freshmen
intermingled.</p>

<p>Early on the evening of the dance, Garvey Gerhart,
who was chairman of the committee on arrangements,
left the college on his way to town
to see that all was in readiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he look pretty!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, who,
with a group of sophomores, stood near Booker
Chapel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he has his dress suit on?&rdquo; asked
Tom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We ought to see if his hair is parted,&rdquo; put in
Sid. &ldquo;Freshmen don&rsquo;t know how to look after
themselves. Have you a clean pocket handkerchief,
Algernon?&rdquo; and he spoke the last in a mocking
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out; there may be another fire,&rdquo; retorted
Gerhart with a grin, and the sophomores could
only grit their teeth. They knew the freshmen still
had the laugh on them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not for long?&rdquo; muttered Phil. &ldquo;Is Dutch
all ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready,&rdquo; answered that worthy for himself.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll slip off to town as soon as it&rsquo;s dusk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think you&rsquo;ll have any trouble in getting in?&rdquo;
asked Ed Kerr.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. I bribed one of the doorkeepers.
Be on hand outside to listen to the fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little before the first arrivals at the freshman
dance had reached the hall, a figure might have
been seen moving quickly about the ballroom in the
dim illumination from the half-turned-down lights.
The figure went about in circles, with curious motions
of the hands, and then, after a survey of the
place and a silent laugh, withdrew.</p>

<p>The music began a dreamy waltz, following the
opening march. Freshmen led their fair partners
out on the floor, and began whirling them about.
The lights twinkled, there was the sweet smell of
flowers, fair faces of the girls looked up into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
proud, flushed ones of the youths. Chaperons
looked on approvingly. The music became a trifle
faster. The dance was in full swing.</p>

<p>Suddenly a girl gave a frightened little cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked her partner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My shoes! They&mdash;they seem to be sticking
to the floor. I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t dance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>From all over the room arose similar cries of
dismay from the girls and exclamations of disgust
from the boys. The dancers went slower and
slower. It was an effort to glide about, and some
could scarcely lift their feet. The floor seemed
to hold them as a magnet does a bit of iron.
Garvey Gerhart, releasing his pretty partner,
leaned over and touched the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as sticky as molasses!&rdquo; he cried in dismay.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

<h3>PHIL GETS A TELEGRAM</h3>


<p>The music stopped with a discord. A strange
spell seemed thrown over the dancers. Some, who
had come to a stop, now tried to move, and found
that their feet were fast to the floor. It was an
effort to lift them. The surface that had seemed
well waxed was now as sticky as if glue had been
poured over it. To walk was almost impossible;
to dance, out of the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s only in a few places, and we can
scrape it off,&rdquo; suggested Will Foster, a chum of
Gerhart. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He endeavored, with his knife, to remove some
of the sticky stuff, but he might as well have tried
to dig up a board in the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Gerhart&rsquo;s partner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered ruefully. &ldquo;Something
very sticky has gotten on the floor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe some of the waiters spilled ice cream
or coffee, or some candy got there,&rdquo; she suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is stickier than any of those things,&rdquo; spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Gerhart. &ldquo;I&mdash;I guess some one has played a trick
on us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A trick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; the sophomores. I should have been more
on the lookout, but I didn&rsquo;t think they could get in.
I told the men at the door not to let any one in
who didn&rsquo;t have a freshman pin. But&mdash;well, we&rsquo;ll
wait a bit and see if it dries up,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>

<p>But the stuff on the floor didn&rsquo;t dry up. Instead,
it became more sticky. The ballroom was like one
big sheet of adhesive flypaper, and the dancers,
walking about, felt their shoes pull up with queer
little noises every time they took a step. They
tried to dance once more, but it was a miserable
failure. One might as well have tried to waltz
or two-step on the sands of the seashore.</p>

<p>Then from a window there sounded the old
song: &ldquo;<a href="#image03">Clarence McFadden, He Wanted to
Waltz</a>.&rdquo; The chagrined dancers turned to the
casement, to behold a circle of mocking faces.
Gerhart looked, too.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">
<a name="image03" id="image03"><img src="images/image03.jpg" width="380" height="600" alt="Clarence McFadden, He Wanted to Waltz" title="Clarence McFadden, He Wanted to Waltz" />
</a><br /><span class="caption">&ldquo;<a href="#Page_173">Clarence McFadden, He Wanted to Waltz</a>&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The sophs!&rdquo; he cried, as he caught sight of
Tom, Phil, Sid, Dutch Housenlager and several
others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At your service!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll
have to dance to slow music to-night!&rdquo; And then,
to show that it was in revenge for the fire scare,
the sophomores sang: &ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s Burning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It worked to perfection, Dutch. However did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
you manage it?&rdquo; asked Tom, as the sophomores,
having satisfied themselves that the freshman
dance had been spoiled, walked back to college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy,&rdquo; answered the fun-loving student. &ldquo;I
mixed up a sticky preparation of glue, varnish, gum
and so on, made it into a powder, and put it in
alcohol. Then I sneaked in past the doorkeeper
I had bribed, and sprinkled the stuff all over the
floor. There was no color to it, and they didn&rsquo;t
notice it. The alcohol kept it from sticking until
after the march, and then, when the alcohol evaporated,
it left the gum ready to do its work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it did it,&rdquo; commented Sid.</p>

<p>It certainly did, for the disconcerted freshman
and the pretty girls soon left the hall. It was impossible
to dance on the floor until the sticky stuff
had been scraped off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was rather a brutal trick, after all,&rdquo; said
Tom to Phil a little later, when the three were
in their room. &ldquo;It would have been all right on
the freshies alone, but the girls&mdash;they had to suffer,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Sid. &ldquo;Why not? <i>Secundum
naturam</i>, you know, according to the course of
nature it had to be. The good with the bad. The
freshies brought it on themselves, eh, Phil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose so,&rdquo; replied the quarter-back,
who was busy with paper and pencil. &ldquo;Still, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
was a bit rough on the lassies. There were some
pretty ones&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you fellows and the girls!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid
in disgust. &ldquo;You make me sick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; went on Tom easily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
get yours some day, and then we&rsquo;ll see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, where&rsquo;d that picture come from?&rdquo; asked
Sid, pointing to another photograph on the wall
beside those of Ruth and Madge. Tom blushed
a bit, and did not answer. Phil looked up and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s another picture of my sister! She
must have had some new ones taken. Where did
it come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She gave it to me,&rdquo; explained Tom, and his
shoelace seemed suddenly to have come unfastened,
so it was necessary to stoop over to tie it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; murmured Phil, with a queer look at
his chum&rsquo;s red face. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t say anything to
me about it. But if you&rsquo;re going to add to our
collection, Tom, I guess it&rsquo;s up to me to get another
one, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose will you get now?&rdquo; asked Sid. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
you got enough girls&rsquo; faces stuck up around here?
Do you want another?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not another,&rdquo; spoke Phil slowly, &ldquo;but another
of the same one. Miss Tyler promised me one
of her new photographs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did?&rdquo; cried Tom, and he turned quickly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; have you any objections?&rdquo; and Phil gazed
straight at Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;oh, no. Of course not,&rdquo; he added hastily,
&ldquo;only I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&mdash; What are you doing?&rdquo;
he asked rather suddenly, changing the subject,
as he saw Phil&rsquo;s paper and pencil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on a new football play,&rdquo; replied
Phil, and he, too, seemed glad that the subject
was changed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like it,&rdquo; commented Sid. &ldquo;Now
you&rsquo;re talking sense. Let&rsquo;s hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; explained Phil, as he showed his
chums what he had drawn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fake tackle
run, and a pass to the right half-back. Nothing
particularly new about it, as it&rsquo;s often used, but
my plan is to work it immediately after we run
off a play of left-tackle through right-tackle and
right-end. After that play has been pulled off,
it will look as if we were trying to repeat it, and
we&rsquo;ll catch the other fellows off their guard. In
this play, the left-tackle, after the signal, turns back
and takes the ball from me. He passes the ball
to the right-half, who turns to the left for a run
around our left-end. Our full-back charges on the
opposing left-tackle, crossing in front of our right-half
to better conceal the ball. The left half-back
helps the left-tackle to make his quick turn, and
then blocks off the opposing right-end, while I help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
make interference for the right-half, who&rsquo;s got the
ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds good,&rdquo; commented Tom. &ldquo;Go
over it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which Phil did, and his two chums both declared
it ought to work well. They tried it in
practice against the scrub next day, after Coach
Lighton and Captain Holly Cross had given their
approval to it. The play operated like a charm,
and was good for a touch-down. It completely
fooled the second eleven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It remains to be seen whether it will do the
same thing against another team,&rdquo; said the coach.
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll try it Saturday against the Dodville
Prep School. Now, boys, line up, and we&rsquo;ll run
through it again? Also the forward pass and the
on-side kick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The players were in the midst of a scrimmage,
and Joe Jackson had just made a fine run, when
Wallops was seen coming across the gridiron. The
messenger had an envelope in his hand, and at the
sight of him Phil Clinton turned pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get back, Wallops!&rdquo; cried the coach. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
in the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a telegram for Mr. Clinton,&rdquo; said the
messenger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right. Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil&rsquo;s hand were trembling so he could hardly
open the message. He read it at a glance. Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
went close to him, and put his hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it&mdash;is it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dad says to hold myself in readiness to come
at any time,&rdquo; said Phil slowly.</p>

<p>There was silence among the players, all of
whom knew of the serious illness of Phil&rsquo;s mother.
Coach Lighton went up to the quarter-back and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t practice any more to-day. It&rsquo;s
too bad, Clinton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil swallowed two or three times. He forced
back a mistiness that was gathering like a film over
his eyes. He thrust the telegram into his jacket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go on with the practice,&rdquo; he said sturdily.
&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t perfect in that fake tackle run yet, and
I want to use it against Dodville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a plucky answer, and many a hardy player
on the Randall eleven felt a new liking for the
quarter-back as he went to his place behind Snail
Looper, who stooped to receive the ball.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

<h3>STRANGE BEDFELLOWS</h3>


<p>The practice was over. Phil stuck to it until
he had, with the assistance of the coach and the
captain, drilled the &rsquo;varsity into an almost perfect
running of the trick play. Of course, how it would
work against fierce opponents was another matter.
But, in spite of the shock engendered by the receipt
of the telegram, Phil would not give up until the
men fairly &ldquo;snapped&rdquo; into place, after he had
given the signal for the fake tackle run and pass
to the half-back. Now he and Tom were on their
way to their room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, Phil?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the despondent answer. &ldquo;I&mdash;of
course, I&rsquo;ll have to go when I get word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;s worse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so; or else they&rsquo;re going to operate.
But don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about it. It breaks me all
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think it would. I don&rsquo;t see how you
could stay in practice after you got the message.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt as if I had to, Tom. Of course, I know
I&rsquo;m only a small factor in the eleven&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re a pretty big one,&rdquo; interrupted
the left-end enthusiastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, thank you for that; but I mean relatively.
I&rsquo;m only one of eleven players, and my place could
be filled. Still, I do flatter myself that I&rsquo;ve got the
team into some kind of machine-like precision,
which is very needful in a game. I don&rsquo;t mean
that I&rsquo;ve done it all alone, for I haven&rsquo;t. Every
man has done more than his share, and with a
coach like Mr. Lighton, and a captain like Holly
Cross, a fellow can do a lot. But I&rsquo;m a cog in the
wheels of the machine, and you know how it is
when you put a new wheel in a bit of apparatus.
It may be just as good, or better than the old
one, but it&rsquo;s got to take time to work off the rough
spots and fit in smoothly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I feel. I want to stay in the
game and at practice as long as I can, for when I
drop out, and a new quarter-back comes in, it&rsquo;s
bound to throw the playing off the least bit, and
I&rsquo;m not patting myself on the back when I say that,
I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you&rsquo;re not! But it must be nervous
work running a team when you know&mdash;well,
er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and Tom stopped in some confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Phil simply. &ldquo;But you can do
lots of things when you try hard. I&rsquo;m going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
do this. I&rsquo;ll hold myself in readiness to jump
down to Palm Beach when I get the word, but until
then I&rsquo;m going to stick by the team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a look on Phil&rsquo;s face that Tom had
never seen there before. It was as if some inner
power was urging him along the difficult path that
lay before him. He seemed to be drawing on a
hidden reserve supply of grit and pluck, and, as he
passed up the stairs, with an easy, swaying motion
of his athletic body, Tom could not help but admiring
his good-looking, well-formed chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I hope nothing happens to take him away
before we play our last game,&rdquo; whispered the &rsquo;varsity
pitcher. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the best quarter Randall ever
had, if what the old-timers say is true. If we don&rsquo;t
win the championship I&rsquo;ll miss my guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kept on up the stairs after Phil. In the
corridor stood Ford Fenton. Phil nodded at him,
but did not feel like speaking. His fingers were
clasped around the telegram in his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; cried Fenton. &ldquo;I saw you at practice.
That&rsquo;s a dandy trick you worked, Phil. My uncle
says that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ford,&rdquo; began Tom gravely, &ldquo;have you ever
had smallpox?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smallpox? My good gracious, no! You don&rsquo;t
mean to say that there&rsquo;s a case of it here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been exposed to smallpox,&rdquo; went
on Tom, &ldquo;but we are both suffering from a severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
attack of Uncleitis, so if you don&rsquo;t want to catch
it you&rsquo;d better keep away from us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hu! I guess you think that&rsquo;s a joke!&rdquo; exclaimed
Ford as he turned and walked away. Then
Tom and Phil entered their room.</p>

<p>Something in the look of their faces attracted
the attention of Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked, despite Tom&rsquo;s
frantic gestures behind Phil&rsquo;s back, which motions
were made with a view to keeping Sid quiet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have to go&mdash;go where my
mother is, any minute,&rdquo; said Phil brokenly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
guess I&rsquo;ll pack up so&mdash;so&rsquo;s to be ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the tension broke, and the nervous force
that had girt him about when he was on the gridiron
gave way, and he sobbed brokenly. Tom instantly
began rearranging the books on the table,
where they were piled in artistic confusion, and
raised such a dust that Sid sneezed. The latter
was in the old armchair, which had been mended,
after a fashion, following the throwing of it from
the window in the fire scare. As Sid tried to get
up from the depths of it, there came a crash, and
the antique piece of furniture settled heavily on
one side, like a ship with a bad list to port.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go!&rdquo; cried Tom, glad to have a
chance to speak sharply. &ldquo;What are you trying
to do&mdash;smash it all to pieces? Can&rsquo;t you get out
of a chair without busting it?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; spoke Sid so gently, and
in such a contrast to Tom&rsquo;s fiery words, that Phil
could not restrain an exclamatory chuckle. It was
just the thing needed to change the current that
was setting too strongly toward sadness, and a
moment later the three were carefully examining
the chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a leg broken,&rdquo; said Phil at length,
and during the inspection he kept his face in the
shadow. &ldquo;I can fix it to-morrow,&rdquo; he went on,
and when he arose he was himself again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better put an iron brace on, if Sid is going to
do double back somersaults in it,&rdquo; went on Tom
with simulated indignity. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a barn, Sid.
It&rsquo;s a gentlemen&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you shut up!&rdquo; cried Sid, and then the
chums were more natural.</p>

<p>Phil arranged that night to leave college at once,
in case further bad news was received, and he also
communicated with Ruth, planning to take her
with him. But there was no need, for in the morning
another message was received, saying that Mrs.
Clinton had somewhat recovered from the relapse
that threatened.</p>

<p>Phil said little, but there was a different air about
him all that day, and when he went into practice
he actually seemed to carry the team along on his
shoulders, so that they crumbled the scrub opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
into nothingness, and made five touch-downs
in the two short halves they played.</p>

<p>Since the episode of the freshman dance the first-year
students had &ldquo;sung small&rdquo; whenever the
sophomores were about. It was the most humiliating
trick that had been &ldquo;pulled off in so many years
that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary,&rdquo;
as Holly Cross put it in one of his favorite
quotations. Gerhart was much downcast at first,
for, as he was in charge of the affair, it was considered
a sort of reflection on his ability. And he
laid it all to Tom, Sid, Phil and Dutch Housenlager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wait; I&rsquo;ll get even with you some day,&rdquo;
he had said to Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re perfectly willing,&rdquo; answered Tom good-naturedly.
&ldquo;If you think you can put anything
over our home plate, why go ahead, and more
power to ye, as Bricktop Molloy would say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just wait,&rdquo; was all Gerhart answered.</p>

<p>It was the night before the game with Dodville
Preparatory School, which institution had an eleven
not to be despised. They had met Randall on the
diamond and were anxious to come to conclusions
with them on the gridiron. Following some light
practice, during which the fake tackle run and pass
to half-back was worked to perfection, Sid, Tom
and Phil went for a stroll along Sunny River. The
placid stream had an attraction in the early evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
that was absent at other times, and the three chums
felt its influence as they walked along the banks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you feel nervous about to-morrow&rsquo;s game?&rdquo;
asked Tom of Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not as much so as if it was against Boxer
Hall,&rdquo; replied the quarter-back. &ldquo;Of course I&mdash;I
shall be worrying a bit for fear I&rsquo;ll get a message
from Florida, but I&rsquo;m going to try to forget it.
I want to roll up a big score against Dodville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And against Boxer Hall, too,&rdquo; added Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. But that&rsquo;s some time off, and we&rsquo;ll
improve in the meanwhile. I fancy the game to-morrow
will develop some weak spots that will
need strengthening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They walked and talked for about an hour, and
it was dark when they returned to their room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No study to-night,&rdquo; remarked Phil, as he began
to disrobe. &ldquo;Me for pounding the pillow at once,
if not sooner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; came from Tom, and he began
taking off his things. &ldquo;Last fellow to undress puts
the light out,&rdquo; he added, and then there was a
race. Tom and Phil leaped into bed almost at
once, and Sid, leaving the light turned on, was
scarcely a second behind them. There was a protesting
howl from Phil and Tom at their chum&rsquo;s
perfidy, but the next instant Tom uttered a yell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! Ouch! Something&rsquo;s in my bed!&rdquo; he
cried as he leaped out.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And in mine, too!&rdquo; came from Sid. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
snake!&rdquo; and reaching down between the sheets, he
pulled out a long reptile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cæsar&rsquo;s Haywagon!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve drawn
something, too!&rdquo; and with that he held up a mudturtle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand thistles!&rdquo; yelled Tom as he began
pulling off his pajamas. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m full of needles!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

<h3>A CHANGE IN SIGNALS</h3>


<p>The scene in the room was one of confusion.
Tom was dancing about, rubbing first here and
then there on his anatomy. The snake which Sid
held was wiggling as if in protest at being suspended
by the tail, and was tying itself into all sorts
of complicated knots and geometrical figures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out, it may bite you!&rdquo; cried Phil, who was
holding the mudturtle by the tail, the feet of the
animal working back and forth in a vain effort to
get a grip on the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a poisonous snake,&rdquo; declared Sid, who
was something of a naturalist. &ldquo;But I wonder who
played this trick on us? What ails you, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; what are you wiggling around in that
fashion for, son?&rdquo; inquired Phil, who began to
laugh, now that the extent of the scare was evident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wiggle! I guess you would, too, if some one
had filled your bed with needles that came right
through your pajamas,&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Needles?&rdquo; from Sid.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Needles?&rdquo; reiterated Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, needles; ten million of them, by the way
I feel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil placed the mudturtle in the wash basin,
where it vainly tried to climb up the slippery porcelain
sides. Then he went over to Tom&rsquo;s bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are no needles here,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No? What are they, then?&rdquo; demanded Tom,
continuing to rub himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chestnut burrs,&rdquo; replied his chum, after a more
careful inspection. &ldquo;Some one has taken the stickers
off a lot of chestnut burrs and scattered them
in your bed. No wonder they went through your
pajamas. I&rsquo;d rather have the mudturtle than
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or a snake,&rdquo; added Sid. &ldquo;I wonder who did
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil pulled back the covers from Tom&rsquo;s bed.
At the foot, between the sheets, was a piece of
paper. The quarter-back made a grab for it and
read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Compliments of the freshmen. Maybe you
won&rsquo;t be so smart next time.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;The freshmen!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make
them smart for this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve made you smart already,&rdquo; commented
Sid, as he put his snake in a pasteboard box, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
carefully closed it with a weight on top. &ldquo;I guess
they got ahead of us this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Gerhart&rsquo;s writing,&rdquo; went on Phil, looking
closely at the note. &ldquo;He originated the scheme.
Let&rsquo;s see if any other fellows have suffered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They partly dressed, and stole silently to the
rooms of some of their classmates. No one else
had felt the vengeance of the freshmen, and our
friends concluded that the performance had been
arranged for their special benefit, on account of
the friction they had had with Gerhart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How am I going to sleep in that bed to-night?&rdquo;
asked Tom ruefully, when they had returned to
their room. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like being in a beehive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; said Phil, and he carefully took
off the sheets, folding them up so that the chestnut
stickers would not be scattered. &ldquo;You can do without
sheets to-night, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; went on Tom. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m
going to get another pair of pajamas. Those feel
too much like a new flannel shirt,&rdquo; and he went
to his trunk, which he began ransacking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can we do to get square?&rdquo; asked Sid, as
he again prepared to get into bed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to
teach Gerhart a lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll discuss it
in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was not so easy as they had supposed to
think up a joke to play on the inventive freshman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
that would be commensurate with the trick
he had perpetrated on them. Besides, Gerhart
kept pretty well with his own crowd of classmates,
and, as there was safety in numbers, and as our
three friends did not want a general class fight,
they were, to a certain extent, handicapped. By
Gerhart&rsquo;s grins they knew that he was aware of
their discomfiture of the night previous. Tom was
sorely tempted to come to fistic conclusions with
the freshman, but Sid and Phil dissuaded him,
promising to unite with him on some scheme of
vengeance. The mudturtle and snake were retained
by Sid, who had a small collection of live
things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must keep this to ourselves,&rdquo; suggested
Phil that morning, as they started for chapel.
&ldquo;Only our own fellows must hear of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Tom and Sid, but they soon
found, from the greetings of the juniors, seniors
and freshmen, that the story was all over the
school. In fact, to this day the yarn is handed
down in the annals of Randall College as an example
of how a freshman, single-handed, played a
joke on three sophomores; for it developed that
Gerhart had done the trick alone.</p>

<p>It was a day or two after this, when Tom and
Phil were walking along the river after football
practice, that, down near the bridge, they saw
Gerhart just ahead of them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chance to take a fall out of him,&rdquo;
suggested Tom, whose appetite for vengeance was
still unappeased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Phil. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s catch up to
him and toss him into the river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They quickened their steps, but a moment later
they saw a young man come from the bushes at
one end of the bridge and join Gerhart. The two
walked briskly on, and, as Tom and Phil could see,
they were engaged in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do anything now,&rdquo; spoke Tom.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a stranger. He&rsquo;s not of Randall College.
Look at his cap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s from some college,&rdquo; declared Phil. &ldquo;That
cap seems familiar. I wonder who he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it up,&rdquo; spoke Tom. &ldquo;We might as well
go back now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were about to turn when suddenly the lad
with Gerhart swung about and made a violent gesture
of dissent. Then Tom and Phil heard him
say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with such a dirty trick,
and you ought to be ashamed to make the offer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that so?&rdquo; asked Gerhart, and he did not
seem nonplussed. &ldquo;Well, maybe some other fellow
will be glad to get what I have to offer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; exclaimed the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
done with you, and that settles it,&rdquo; and he crashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
into the bushes and disappeared, leaving Gerhart
alone on the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see who that was?&rdquo; asked Tom, looking
at Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I couldn&rsquo;t make out his face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was George Stoddard, captain of the Boxer
Hall eleven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Phil. &ldquo;I knew I&rsquo;d seen
him before. But he didn&rsquo;t look as he used to in a
baseball uniform. I wonder what he and Gerhart
had on the carpet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, probably Gerhart wanted him to go to
some sporty gambling affair. I hear he plays quite
a high game at cards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerhart. Lots of the freshmen of our college
have found his pace too fast for them. He and
Langridge are thicker than ever. Probably Gerhart
wanted some new easy-marks to win from,
and is trying to take up with the Boxer Hall boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. But Stoddard turned him
down cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; didn&rsquo;t make any bones about it. Well, I
s&rsquo;pose we could catch up to Gerhart now. But
what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Hello! There&rsquo;s Langridge joining
him now, Phil,&rdquo; and as Tom spoke they saw
the sophomore come from a side path and walk
along with the freshman. The two began talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
earnestly, and from the manner of Gerhart it
seemed that something had gone wrong, and that
he was endeavoring to explain.</p>

<p>Tom and Phil forgot the little scene of the afternoon
when they got down to studying that night,
and as lessons were getting to be pretty &ldquo;stiff,&rdquo; to
quote Sid, it was necessary to put in considerable
time over books. The three &ldquo;boned&rdquo; away until
midnight, and after an inspection of their beds, to
make sure that no contraband articles were between
the sheets, they turned out the light and were soon
slumbering.</p>

<p>The next day Phil was turned back in Greek,
and had to write out a difficult exercise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell Mr. Lighton I&rsquo;ll be ready for practice in
half an hour,&rdquo; he said to Tom, as the latter hurried
off to get into his football togs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come
as soon as Pitchfork lets me off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered his chum.</p>

<p>When Tom got to the gridiron he found most
of the &rsquo;varsity eleven there. Coach Lighton was
in earnest conversation with Captain Holly Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Phil?&rdquo; asked the coach as Tom came
up. The left-end explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come into the gym, fellows,&rdquo; went on the
coach. &ldquo;I have something important to tell you.
Phil will be along soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vainly wondering what was in the wind, and
whether, by any chance, it concerned Phil, Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
followed the sturdy lads across the field. Phil
joined the throng before the gymnasium was
reached.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we going to
practice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the coach; &ldquo;but first we&rsquo;ve got to
arrange for a new set of signals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;New signals?&rdquo; cried half a dozen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have just learned, in an anonymous
communication, that an offer was made to a rival
college to sell our signals. The offer, I am glad
to say, was indignantly refused; but if some one is
in possession of our system, we must get a new
one. Now, if you will come in here I will change
the signals, and we will then go to practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom and Phil instinctively looked at each other.
The memory of the scene between Gerhart and
Stoddard, and Langridge&rsquo;s later presence with the
freshman, came to them both at once.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

<h3>BATTERING BOXER HALL</h3>


<p>There was a little buzz of talk, following the
announcement of the coach. Each player looked
at his neighbor, as if to learn whether or not he
was the guilty one. But Mr. Lighton at once
called a halt to this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will say,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that no member of
the &rsquo;varsity team, nor has any substitute, been
guilty of this mean, sneaking piece of business. I
don&rsquo;t even know who it was. I don&rsquo;t want to
know. I don&rsquo;t know to whom the offer was made.
I don&rsquo;t want to know. But we are going to protect
ourselves, and change the signals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a comparatively simple matter, the way
the signals had been devised, to so change them so
that another team, even with a copy of the originals,
would have found it impossible to know in
advance what the plays were to be.</p>

<p>Half an hour was spent in going over the new
combinations while the team was in the gymnasium,
and then they went out on the field to play against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the scrub. It was a little awkward at first for Phil
to run the eleven under the new system, and he
made one or two blunders. But the scrub was
beaten by a good score.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do better to-morrow,&rdquo; commented the
coach. &ldquo;It is a little troublesome, I know, to use
the new letters and figures, but we&rsquo;ll practice on
them constantly until we meet Boxer Hall on Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was to be the first game of the season with
Boxer Hall, the college, which, with Fairview Institute
and Randall, formed the Tonoka Lake
League. The Randallites were on edge for it, and
they had need to be, for Boxer had a fine eleven,
better than in many years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have all we want to do to beat them,&rdquo;
said Phil to a crowd of his chums after practice
one day. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re in better shape than Fairview
was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So are we,&rdquo; declared Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to
win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you do,&rdquo; remarked Ford Fenton. &ldquo;They
have a peculiar way of playing the game in the first
half. My uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; It was a simultaneous howl from the
crowd of lads. They sometimes did this when
Ford&rsquo;s reminiscences got on their nerves. The lad
with the uncle turned away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to put you on to some of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
tricks,&rdquo; he continued in injured tones. &ldquo;Now I
won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Write it out and hand it to Holly Cross,&rdquo; suggested
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Phil,&rdquo; remarked Tom to his chum on
Saturday, about an hour before the big game, when
the team was dressing in the Randall gymnasium,
&ldquo;do you feel as if we were going to win?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly do,&rdquo; spoke the quarter-back as he
laced his canvas jacket. &ldquo;I never felt in better
shape. Only for one thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused suddenly,
but Tom knew what he meant. It was the
fear that, in the midst of the game, he might get
bad news about his mother. Since receiving the
telegram advising him to be ready to leave for
Florida on short notice, Phil and his sister had had
word that their mother had rallied somewhat, but
that no permanent hope was held out for her recovery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try not to think about it, old man,&rdquo; advised
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I do try,&rdquo; responded Phil. &ldquo;But it&mdash;it&rsquo;s
hard work,&rdquo; and he bent over to tie his shoe.</p>

<p>Out on the gridiron trotted the Randall players.
They were received with a burst of cheers,
led by Bean Perkins, whose voice was more than
ever like a foghorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give &rsquo;em the &lsquo;Conquer or Die&rsquo; song,&rdquo; he called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; wait until they need it,&rdquo; suggested Sid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Henderson, who was in the grandstand. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
sing &lsquo;We&rsquo;re Going to Make a Touch-down Now!&rsquo;
That&rsquo;ll be better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The verses and chorus welled out from several
hundred lusty throats, and the Randall team, which
was at quick practice, looked up in appreciation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if any of the Fairview girls will be
here,&rdquo; said Tom as he and Phil were passing the
ball back and forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about all of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; replied the
quarter-back, &ldquo;but Ruth and Madge are coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since when have you been calling her
&lsquo;Madge&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Tom, with a sharp look at his
chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since she gave me permission,&rdquo; was the answer,
and Phil booted the pigskin well down the
field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how long is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What difference does it make to you?&rdquo; and
there was a shade of annoyance in Phil&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, only I&mdash;er&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash; There they
come!&rdquo; cried Tom suddenly, but it was not to the
girls that he referred. The Boxer Hall team had
just trotted out, to be received with a round of
cheers from their partisans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Husky-looking lot,&rdquo; observed Ed Kerr, as he
and the other Randall players gazed critically at
their opponents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are that,&rdquo; conceded Bricktop Molloy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
one of the biggest guards who ever supported a
center.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;ll do us,&rdquo; came from Snail
Looper, who was not of a very hopeful turn of
mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Don&rsquo;t talk that way, me lad!&rdquo; objected
Bricktop, lapsing into brogue, as he always
did when very much in earnest. &ldquo;Just because
they&rsquo;re a lot of big brutes doesn&rsquo;t argue that we
can&rsquo;t smash through them. <i>Omnis sequitur</i>, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you and your Latin!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t we get enough of that in class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine language,&rdquo; went on Molloy, who was
a good classical scholar. &ldquo;But suppose we line
up and run a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The practice was over, the preliminaries had all
been arranged, the new ball was brought out and
handed to Boxer Hall, for Captain Stoddard had
won the toss, and elected to kick off. The yellow
spheroid was placed on the center line, on top of
a little mound of earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you all ready?&rdquo; asked the referee, and
Captain Holly Cross cast a quick eye on his team,
which, spread out on their field, was like an aggregation
of eager foxhounds, waiting for the
start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; answered Holly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; responded Stoddard.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The whistle sounded shrilly, and a moment later
Pinkey Davenport&rsquo;s good right toe had met the
pigskin with a resounding &ldquo;thump,&rdquo; and the ball
was sailing toward the Randall goal.</p>

<p>Jerry Jackson caught it and began scuttling back
toward the center of the field. Tom, with Ed Kerr
and Bricktop Molloy, formed interference for him,
and with their efficient aid Jerry rushed the leather
back for thirty yards, or to within five yards of the
middle of the gridiron. There he was downed with
a vicious tackle by Dave Ogden, who had managed
to get through between Tom and Bricktop, though
they flung themselves at him. Jerry lay still for
a moment after falling, with the ball tightly clasped
in his arms. Captain Cross ran to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Only&mdash;only a little wind knocked out of
me,&rdquo; answered the plucky left half-back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
all right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Line up, fellows!&rdquo; cried Holly, and Phil began
rattling off a string of numbers and letters.</p>

<p>It was a signal for Kindlings to take the ball
through tackle, and, as he got it, the right half-back
leaped for the hole that was opened for him.
Right through he plunged, staggering along, half
pulled, half shoved, until it was impossible to gain
another inch, and Kindlings was buried out of
sight under an avalanche of players. But the required
gain had been made, and Phil signaled for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
another try at the Boxer Hall line. Captain Stoddard
was vainly calling on his men to brace and
hold their opponents, while from the grandstand
came wild cheers at the first sign of prowess on
the part of Randall.</p>

<p>This time Holly Cross went through guard and
tackle for a fine gain, and next he was sent between
right-tackle and end. So far there had not
been a halt in the progress of bucking the line,
but when, on the next play, Ed Kerr was called on
to go through between left-end and tackle, he felt
as if he had hit a number of bags of sand. There
was not a foot of gain, and Ed barely saved the
ball, which bounced from his arms; but he fell on
it like a flash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try there again,&rdquo; whispered Kerr to Phil,
as he took his position once more. Phil, however,
had seen that the Boxer Hall line was weak, and
he determined for another try at it, but in a different
place. This time Jerry Jackson was called on
for a run around right-end, and so successful was
it that he went to the twenty-five-yard line before
he was heavily thrown. The tackling of the Boxer
Hall lads was severe when they got a chance at
it.</p>

<p>Phil, in a flash, determined for a field goal trial.
The chances were in favor of it, for there was no
wind, and the position was right. Besides, if it
was successful it would add immensely to the spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of his team, and give them a rest from the hard
line bucking.</p>

<p>Quickly he gave the signal, and Holly Cross ran
to the thirty-yard line for a drop kick. The ball
came back and was cleanly caught. The Randall
line held, and Holly booted the pigskin in fine
shape, but with a groan almost of anguish the
players and supporters of the college by the river
saw the ball strike the cross-bar and bounce back.
The attempt had failed.</p>

<p>The leather was brought out to the twenty-five-yard
line, and Boxer Hall prepared for her turn
at it. On the first try they gained fifteen yards
through a hole that was ripped between Grasshopper
Backus and Dutch Housenlager. They
then gathered in ten more by a run around Tom&rsquo;s
end, though he made a desperate effort to stop the
man with the ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right through &rsquo;em, now, fellows!&rdquo; called Captain
Stoddard to his players. &ldquo;Rip &rsquo;em up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold &rsquo;em! Hold &rsquo;em!&rdquo; besought Holly Cross.</p>

<p>And hold the Randallites did. The wave of
attack fell back in a sort of froth of players as
Pinkey Davenport tried in vain to gain through
center. Snail Looper was like a great rock. Once
more there was a try at the line, Dave Ogden being
sent in with a rush. But he only gained three yards,
and it was inevitable that Boxer would punt. The
backs of the Randall team ran toward their goal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
but Boxer worked a pretty trick, and on a double
pass made fifteen yards before the man was
stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; cried the Boxer coach, and
he ran on the field to whisper to Captain Stoddard.</p>

<p>But the thoughtless action of the coach brought
its punishment, for Boxer was penalized ten yards
on account of their trainer coming on the field without
permission. There was much kicking at this,
but the officials insisted, and it stood. Then, with
a net gain of less than was needed, and on the last
down, Boxer had to kick. Holly Cross got the
ball and rushed it well back before he was downed.</p>

<p>So far the playing had been pretty even. Though
Boxer was a bit weak on defense, they played a
snappy game, and seemed to be able to outgeneral
their opponents. Now Randall had another chance
to show what they could do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give &rsquo;em the &lsquo;Conquer or Die&rsquo; song now!&rdquo; cried
Bean Perkins, and the strains of &ldquo;<i>Aut vincere aut
mori</i>&rdquo; welled out over the gridiron. It seemed to
give just the stimulus needed, and when Kindlings
had been sent crashing into the line for a twelve-yard
gain, Phil quickly resolved on the fake tackle
and pass to half-back play. First, however, he
called for Ed Kerr to make a try through right-tackle,
and when this had been accomplished, with
a smashing force that temporarily demoralized the
Boxer Hall players, Kindlings was once more requested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to oblige. He took the ball from Ed, who
had received it from Phil, and around right-end
he went, with beautiful interference. It completely
fooled the other team, and when the Boxer full-back
finally managed to stop Kindlings it was on
the ten-yard line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Touch-down! Touch-down!&rdquo; yelled the Randall
supporters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Touch-down it shall be!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil.</p>

<p><a href="#image01">Smash and hammer, hammer and smash</a>, batter
and push it was for the next three minutes! Boxer
was desperate, and with tears in their eyes her
players sought to stem the tide rushing against
them. But Randall was not to be denied. Again
and again her men went battering against the wall
of flesh and blood, until, with what seemed a superhuman
effort, Holly Cross was shoved over the
line for a touch-down.</p>

<p>Oh, what yelling and cheering there was then!
Even the voice of Bean Perkins, strident as it was,
could not be heard above the others. The grandstands
were trembling with the swaying, yelling,
stamping mass of enthusiasts congregated on them.</p>

<p>Holly Cross kicked a beautiful goal, and with
the score six to nothing against them, Boxer Hall
prepared to continue the game. There was no
let up to the play. It was fast and furious. For
a time it seemed that Boxer would score, as, after
getting possession of the ball by means of a forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
pass, they ripped off twenty yards, and followed
that up by gathering in ten more by a smashing
play through center. Snail Looper was knocked
out, and had to go to the side lines, Rod Everet
replacing him. This, to a certain extent, weakened
the team, and Randall could not seem to hold.
The ball was rushed along until it was within three
yards of the maroon and yellow goal. Then, responding
nobly to the entreaties which Holly Cross,
made, his players held stiffly, and Randall got the
ball on downs. No time was lost in booting the
pigskin out of danger, and before another formation
could be made the whistle blew, and the first
half was over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; remarked Coach Lighton in the
dressing-room during the rest, &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t tell you
that you&rsquo;ve got to play for all you&rsquo;re worth to win
this game. We&rsquo;re going to have trouble this half.
With Looper gone, though I expect Everet will do
nearly as well at center, it means a certain loss of
team work. But do your best. Their line isn&rsquo;t
as strong as I feared, but they play much fiercer
in the attack than I expected. However, I think
you can rip &rsquo;em up. Get another touch-down&mdash;two
if you can&mdash;and prevent them from scoring.
They may try for a field goal. If they do, get
through and block the kick. Now rest all you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second half started in fiercely. Randall
kicked off, and succeeded in nailing the Boxer Hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
man with the ball before he had run ten yards. But
when the line-bucking began something seemed to
be the matter with the Randall players. They were
shoved back very easily, it appeared, and, with constant
gains, the ball was carried toward their territory.
So eager did the Randallites get at one
stage that they played off-side, and were penalized
ten yards. Again there was holding in the line,
and ten yards more were given to Boxer Hall for
this. The opponents of Randall were now within
thirty yards of the goal. By a smash through center
they ripped off five more. Then Pinkey Davenport
dropped back for a trial for a field goal, and
made it. The score was now six to five in favor
of Randall.</p>

<p>When Randall got the ball again there was a
change at once noticed. More confidence was felt,
and so fiercely did her players assail the line that
they carried the pigskin, in three rushes, well toward
the middle of the field.</p>

<p>Phil gave the signal for a forward pass, and it
was well executed. Then came a fake kick, and
this was followed by an on-side one. Both netted
good gains, and once more Randall was jubilant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right through the line!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;Eat &rsquo;em
up, fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His players responded to his call. Through
tackle, guard and center, then around the end, the
plays being repeated, the ball was carried. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
men were tiring, but Phil would not chance a kick.
They had no sure thing of a field goal now, as a
little wind had sprung up. Up and up the field
the spheroid, yellow no longer, but dirty and grass-stained,
was carried. On the Randallites took it,
until they were on the twenty-five-yard line. There
was a form of madness among the college supporters
now. Once more came the fierce cries for a
touch-down, and once more Phil called to his teammates
to respond. The signal for some sequence
plays was given. It was well these had been practiced,
for Phil&rsquo;s voice could scarcely be heard. One
after another four plays were reeled off. They
were all effective, and though Boxer Hall tried
to stem the rush, it was impossible. Over the line
went the Randall lads, to the inspiring chorus of:
&ldquo;Tear &rsquo;Em Apart and Toss &rsquo;Em Aside!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Touch-down! Touch-down! Touch-down!&rdquo;
came the frantic cries, the players mingling their
voices with those of the spectators on the grandstand.
The goal was missed, but the score was
now eleven to five in favor Randall.</p>

<p>Again came the line-up after the kick off. By
a fumble Boxer lost the ball, and Tom Parsons fell
on it. Then began another fierce attack on the
Boxer eleven. But the terrific line-smashing was
telling on both teams, though more so on Randall.
There was less power in her attack.</p>

<p>Boxer held for downs, and the kick was a weak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
one, the ball going only a short distance. Then
Boxer Hall began to rush it back, and by a trick
play got it so far down the gridiron that another
field goal was kicked. It began to look dubious
for Randall, but there was no give-up in her playing.
Securing the ball, Phil kept his players on
the rush. Down the field they went, a forward
pass netting a good gain and wonderfully saving
the wind of the now almost exhausted team. An
on-side kick was also used, and then, seeing a weak
place in the adversary&rsquo;s line, Phil in turn sent
Kindlings, Jerry Jackson and Holly Cross at it.
In vain did Boxer Hall try to stop up the gap, but
their left-tackle and guard were about all in. In
two minutes more Bricktop Molloy was shoved
over the line for a third touch-down, and, as goal
was kicked, the score was seventeen to ten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One more touch-down!&rdquo; cried Holly Cross,
but there was no time for it. Two minutes more
of play and the whistle blew. Randall had won
one of the fiercest games she had ever played.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cheer for Boxer Hall!&rdquo; cried Holly Cross,
and the despondent players, grieving over their
defeat, sent back an answer. Then came cheer
upon cheer from the grandstand, where waved the
yellow and maroon of Randall, and Bean Perkins
led in the song: &ldquo;We Have Come and We Have
Conquered!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Great, old man!&rdquo; cried Tom to Phil, who was
limping slightly. &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t care if I was in pieces after the
way we walloped them! Come on over here. I
see my sister and Madge!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom followed, his head singing from a severe
knock he had received.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

<h3>GERHART HAS AN IDEA</h3>


<p>Phil&rsquo;s sister hurried down from the grandstand
to greet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Phil!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Did you get hurt?&rdquo;
for she saw him limping, and she held out her
hands to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a little twist,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Not worth
mentioning. How are you, Madge?&rdquo; he went on,
after patting his sister on the shoulder, and he held
his hands eagerly out to Miss Tyler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, wasn&rsquo;t it a great
game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For us,&rdquo; put in Tom, who had greeted Ruth,
and now turned to the other girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Tom,&rdquo; spoke Madge, and
Tom fancied there was just a tinge of coldness in
her voice. She continued talking to Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you think you would win?&rdquo; asked Phil&rsquo;s
sister of Tom as she looked eagerly up into his
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not all the while,&rdquo; replied the left-end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
&ldquo;Once or twice I began to think we&rsquo;d lose. But
you can&rsquo;t down Randall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; it takes Fairview to do that, not Boxer
Hall,&rdquo; put in Madge quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, be nice&mdash;be nice!&rdquo; pleaded Phil with a
laugh. &ldquo;I thought you were a friend of mine,
Madge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I am,&rdquo; she replied gaily; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t help
saying that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll beat you next time,&rdquo; went on Phil, and
he dodged back to escape a little blow which Madge
aimed at him with her small flag. Then the two
laughed. Tom, who was chatting with Ruth,
heard them, and he half turned to see what was
going on. He was just in time to see Phil grasp
both Madge&rsquo;s hands, and his face turned red. Ruth
noticed it, and she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phil and Madge seem to get on well together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost too well,&rdquo; was Tom&rsquo;s thought, but he
said nothing and changed the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Tom,&rdquo; said Phil at length, &ldquo;I suppose
we&rsquo;d better go dress like respectable citizens.
You&rsquo;ve got a spot of mud on your nose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you have one on your ear,&rdquo; added Ruth.
&ldquo;I think Tom&mdash;I mean Mr. Parsons&mdash;looks quite
artistic with that beauty spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can dispense with the &lsquo;Mister,&rsquo; if you like,
Ruth,&rdquo; said Tom boldly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; laughed Ruth. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what my
brother will say. Eh, Phil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess it&rsquo;s safe to call &lsquo;Dominie&rsquo; Parsons
by his front handle,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s warranted
not to bite. Go ahead, sis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she agreed with a laugh. &ldquo;There&mdash;Tom&rdquo;&mdash;and
she hesitated prettily at the name&mdash;&ldquo;better
run along and wash up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you wait here for us?&rdquo; asked Tom.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take you over to Fairview, then, eh, Phil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surest thing you know!&rdquo; exclaimed the quarter-back.
&ldquo;That is, if Madge is agreeable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her. She blushed just a trifle, and,
with a little gesture, answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Ruth insists on having her brother,
why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want my brother!&rdquo; cried Ruth
gaily. &ldquo;Whoever heard of a sister walking with
her own brother? I&rsquo;m going to let you have him,
and I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She paused, blushing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fill in!&rdquo; cried Tom quickly.</p>

<p>Madge looked at him, but said nothing.</p>

<p>A little later on Tom, beside Ruth, and Phil,
walking with Madge, started for the trolley to
Fairview. As they were crossing the campus, which
was thronged with players, visitors and some of
the Boxer Hall team and its supporters, Wallops,
the messenger, came along with a telegram in his
hand.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that for me?&rdquo; asked Phil eagerly, and his
face was pale, while his voice trembled. His sister
looked quickly at him. Evidently she feared the
same thing he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s for Professor Tines,&rdquo; replied the messenger,
and Phil breathed a sigh of relief as
Wallops passed on.</p>

<p>Garvey Gerhart, who, with Langridge, was
standing near Phil at the time, started. Then a
curious look came over his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Langridge,&rdquo; he asked the sophomore, &ldquo;have
you anything to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing special. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you haven&rsquo;t, come along with me. I&rsquo;ve
just thought of an idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re mighty scarce,&rdquo; retorted the former
pitcher. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it get away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a walk over by the chapel, and I&rsquo;ll tell
you,&rdquo; went on Gerhart. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t such a crowd
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil and Tom, with the two girls, were soon
on the way to the co-educational college. The trip
was enlivened by laughter and jokes. Madge and
Phil seemed very good friends, and, as for Tom,
though he wondered at the sudden companionship
that had sprung up between the quarter-back and
the pretty girl he had once been so anxious to get
away from Langridge, he could not help but congratulate
himself on knowing Ruth. Still, he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
not altogether understand Madge. He had been
fond of her&mdash;he was still&mdash;and he knew that she
had liked him. The slender tie of relationship
between them was no bar to an affection that differed
in degree from cousinly. Yet Madge plainly
showed her liking for Phil. Could it be, Tom
thought, that she was jealous of him, and took
this method of showing it? He did not think
Madge would do such a thing, yet he felt that
part of her gaiety and good spirits, when in company
with the handsome quarter-back, were assumed
for some purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t that Ruth is such a nice girl, and
that Phil and I are such friends, I&rsquo;d almost think
that he and I were&mdash;well&mdash;rivals,&rdquo; thought Tom.
&ldquo;Oh, hang it all! What&rsquo;s the use of getting sentimental?
They&rsquo;re both nice girls&mdash;very nice&mdash;the&mdash;the
only trouble is I don&rsquo;t know which I think
the nicer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two chums left the girls at the Fairview
College campus, for it was getting late. Tom shook
hands with Ruth, and then walked over to Madge
to say good-by. She had just finished speaking to
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, when can your &lsquo;cousin&rsquo; come over to see
you again, Madge?&rdquo; asked Tom with a smile.</p>

<p>He held out his hand, but Madge affected not
to see it. Tom felt uncomfortable, and then, as if
she realized it, she said to him:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, &lsquo;Cousin&rsquo; Tom, I don&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;ll
<i>care</i> to come over to see me again,&rdquo; and with that
she turned and walked away.</p>

<p>Tom remained staring after her for a moment.
Then, with a shrug of his shoulders, he wheeled
and joined Phil, who had been a silent witness to
the little scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, aren&rsquo;t girls odd?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; agreed his chum. &ldquo;But you said that
once before, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; did I?&rdquo; asked Tom, and he was rather
silent on the way back to Randall.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Langridge and Gerhart had spent
much time strolling about the chapel walk. It
was getting dusk, and the fading light of the perfect
fall day was shining through the wonderful,
stained-glass windows of the little church. The
long casements, with representations of biblical
scenes, were a soft glow of delicate hues. But the
two lads had no eyes for these beauties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that will put a crimp in his playing!&rdquo;
Gerhart remarked, as he paused to light an oriental
cigarette, or, rather, something that passed for
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s risky,&rdquo; expostulated Langridge. &ldquo;If
it&rsquo;s found out, and it&rsquo;s sure to be, you&rsquo;ll have to
leave college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;d be willing to, if I could have
my revenge on him for keeping me off the team.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
I don&rsquo;t like it here, anyhow. The other game I
put up on him didn&rsquo;t work, but this one will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when will you try it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the last and deciding game. The way I
figure it is that the final tussle will come between
Randall and Boxer Hall. I&rsquo;ll be ready with it
then. It will certainly knock him out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it may lose us the game and the championship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do I care! I&rsquo;ll be square with Clinton,
and that&rsquo;s what I want. I got the idea when I saw
how frightened he was when Wallops had that
telegram. Don&rsquo;t you think it will work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure it will work. It&rsquo;s a great idea, but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
and Langridge hesitated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a brutal
trick, just the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re too chicken-hearted. Come on and
I&rsquo;ll buy you a drink. That will put some life in
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Langridge weakly, and he
went.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<h3>PHIL GIVES UP</h3>


<p>Out on the athletic ground Grasshopper Backus
was practicing the standing broad jump. It was
one of the things he was always at, whence his
nickname. But, as Holly Cross used to say,
&ldquo;Grasshopper had about as much chance of making
the track team as he had of making a perfect score
at tennis,&rdquo; a game which the big lad abhorred. For,
though Grasshopper was very fond of jumping and
practiced it every time he got a chance, there was
something wrong with his method, and he never
could get beyond the preliminaries in a contest.
Still, he kept at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you give up?&rdquo; asked Phil, who, with
Tom and Sid, strolled down where the lone student
was leaping away as if the championship of the
college depended on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you let me alone,&rdquo; objected Grasshopper,
as he prepared for a jump. &ldquo;I beat my own record
a while ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By how much?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not much; a quarter of an inch, but that
shows I&rsquo;m improving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; at that rate you&rsquo;ll be through college, and
a post graduate like Bricktop before you make
enough gain to count,&rdquo; declared Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you let me alone!&rdquo; exclaimed the exasperated
one. With that he jumped, and then, with
a measuring tape, he carefully noted the distance
he had covered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any gain?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I went back an inch then,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like the frog in the well,&rdquo; went on Phil. &ldquo;He
jumped up three feet every day, and fell back four
feet every night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, quit!&rdquo; begged Grasshopper, who was sensitive,
in spite of his enormous bulk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go high enough, but you don&rsquo;t go far
enough,&rdquo; commented Sid. &ldquo;Now, if they allow
hurdling in football, you&rsquo;d be right in it for jumping
over the line to make a touch-down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ll change the rules so as to allow
it,&rdquo; spoke Grasshopper hopefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out, you old Stoic!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;Come
and take a walk with us. Tom is going to blow
us to ginger ale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m going to keep at it until I beat my best
mark,&rdquo; and the jumper again got on the line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curious chap,&rdquo; commented Phil, as the three
chums walked on.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But as good as they make &rsquo;em,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; spoke Sid fervently.</p>

<p>Snail Looper soon recovered from the effects of
the hard Boxer Hall game, and practice was resumed
with the &rsquo;varsity bucking against the scrub.
There was a big improvement shown in the first
team, for the players had demonstrated that they
could meet with an eleven counted among the best,
and win from it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, fellows, are you all ready for the trip
Saturday?&rdquo; asked the Coach at the conclusion of
the practice. &ldquo;None of you are falling behind in
studies, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Cross assured Mr. Lighton that every
man on the team was A1 when it came to scholarship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, a word of advice,&rdquo; went on the coach.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get nervous over this out-of-town trip.
We&rsquo;re going up against a hard team, and on strange
grounds, but just think of it as if you were going
to play Fairview, or Boxer Hall, or Dodville Prep
right here. The worst feature of out-of-town
games is that they throw the men off their stride.
Don&rsquo;t let that happen to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all promised that it should not, and then
the players separated. The coach had arranged
for a game with a distant college&mdash;Wescott University&mdash;which
boasted of a superb eleven. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
meant a long trip on the train, two days spent away
from Randall, and a day to come back in.</p>

<p>The journey to Wescott University was much
enjoyed by the eleven and the substitutes. They
reached the city at dusk, and were at once taken
to the hotel, where quarters had been secured for
them. A big crowd of students had planned to
come from Randall to see the game, a special excursion
train having been arranged for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows, early to bed to-night,&rdquo; stipulated
the coach after supper was over. &ldquo;No skylarking,
and don&rsquo;t go to eating a lot of trash. I want you
all to be on edge. We&rsquo;ll devote to-morrow to
practice, and the next day to wiping up the gridiron
with Wescott.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom and Phil roomed together, and at midnight
Tom, who had just fallen into a doze, after envying
the sound slumber of his chum, was awakened
by the latter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick, Tom,&rdquo; said Phil faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, old man?&rdquo; asked the left-end
anxiously, and he jumped out of bed, turning
on the electric light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m dizzy, and I feel&mdash;well,
rotten, to put it mildly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad. Can I get you anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better call Mr. Lighton. I don&rsquo;t want to take
a lot of dope unless he says so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom quickly dressed and called the coach, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
was on the same floor where all the football players
had their rooms. He came in quickly, and
after one glance at Phil insisted on calling the hotel
physician. The doctor went through the usual procedure,
and left some medicine for Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the coach of the physician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, only his stomach is a little upset.
Change of diet and water will sometimes do it.
He&rsquo;ll be all right in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil was better the next day, but when he went
out to practice with the lads, there was a lassitude
in his movements, and a lack of snap in his manner
of running the team, that made several open their
eyes. Mr. Lighton said nothing, but Tom whispered
to his chum to &ldquo;brace up.&rdquo; Phil tried to,
and managed to get through the practice with some
return of his former vim. He went to bed early
that night, and slept soundly&mdash;too heavily, Tom
thought, as it might indicate fever.</p>

<p>The day of the game, however, Phil seemed all
right. His face was paler than usual, and there
was a grimness about his lips that Tom seldom saw.
The Randall boys had light practice in the morning,
running through the signals, and then took a
rest until it was time to go on the field.</p>

<p>There was a big attendance, and the cheers of
the small contingent of Randall supporters could
hardly be heard. The preliminary practice seemed
to go all right, and when the whistle blew there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
was a confident eleven that lined up against Wescott.
The play was hard and snappy, with much
kicking and open work. The rivals of Randall
had a couple of backs who were excellent punters,
and the visitors were kept busy chasing the ball.
But there came a change, and when Randall had
the pigskin Phil rushed his men up the field to
such good advantage that they scored the first
touch-down, to the no small dismay of the Wescott
team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Phil, some more work like that,&rdquo; said
Holly Cross, but the quarter-back did not answer.</p>

<p>Wescott got possession of the ball toward the
close of the first half, and with surprising power
rushed it up the field. In less time than had been
thought possible they had a touch-down. Randall
lost the pigskin on fumbles, and when Wescott
got it again they kicked a field goal. This ended
the half.</p>

<p>Phil staggered as he walked to the dressing-room
for the rest period.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the coach quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; answered the
quarter-back, and he gritted his teeth hard.</p>

<p>Wescott kicked off in the second half, and Holly
Cross managed to run the ball well back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rip out another touch-down!&rdquo; the captain cried
as he got in place for the first scrimmage. Phil
began on the signal. He hesitated. The players<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
looked at him quickly. He was swaying back and
forth on the ground. Once more he tried to give
the combination of letters and figures. But the
words would not come. He put his hands out to
steady himself, and a moment later, with a groan,
toppled over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hurt!&rdquo; cried Tom as he sprang to the
side of his chum. &ldquo;But I never knew Phil to give
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holly Cross was bending over him, while the
other Randallites crowded up, and the Wescott
lads stretched out on the field. A doctor ran in
from the side lines on a signal from the coach.
He felt of Phil&rsquo;s pulse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the chap has a high fever!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;He has collapsed from it. He can&rsquo;t play any
more! Take him off the field!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A groan went up from the Randall players.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

<h3>SID IS BOGGED</h3>


<p>Phil Clinton opened his eyes. His face, that
had been pale, was now flushed. The reaction had
set in, and he tried to struggle to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Signal!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Eighteen A B X&mdash;two
twenty-seven Z M!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to get in position to take the ball from
Snail Looper, who was standing up, regarding him
curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
you get down to snap it back, Snail? Isn&rsquo;t it our
ball? Have we lost it on a fumble? Are they
beating us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you can&rsquo;t play,&rdquo; spoke Holly Cross
brokenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t play! Nonsense! Of course I can play!
I&rsquo;m all right! I was just knocked out for a minute.
Get down there, Snail. Signal&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But
Phil fell back into the arms of Tom and the doctor,
and lapsed into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carry him off the field,&rdquo; said the medical man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
softly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got lots of grit, but a horse couldn&rsquo;t
play with the fever he has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sorrowfully they carried the stricken quarter-back
from the gridiron. It was a hard blow to the
Randall team, for it meant that a new man would
have to go in and play what was probably the
most exacting position on the team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerry Jackson, go to quarter,&rdquo; called Holly
Cross. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put Hayden at left half-back,&rdquo; and
the substitute was summoned from the side lines.
The play went on, but, as might have been expected,
Randall was at a disadvantage. When they had
the ball they managed to gain considerable ground,
and as much punting as possible was done. But
Wescott tore through for another touch-down,
while the solitary one gained in the first half was
the limit of the scoring the visitors could do. There
did come a brace on the part of Randall toward the
close of the game, and when the whistle blew they
had the ball on the ten-yard line of their opponents.
They had put up a plucky fight against big
odds, and the Wescott players realized it, for they
cheered lustily for their enemies. There was lack
of heartiness, not alone from the sense of defeat,
in the cheer and college yell with which Randall
responded. Then they filed sorrowfully off the
field, while Tom, Holly Cross and the coach, as
soon as possible, went to the hotel where Phil had
been taken in an automobile.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>They imagined all sorts of things, and were not
a little relieved when the doctor told them that,
at worst, Phil only had a bad attack of bilious
fever. The change of diet, necessitated by the
trip, had brought it on. With rest and quiet he
would be all right in a week, the medical man said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when can he play football?&rdquo; asked Holly
Cross anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for two weeks,&rdquo; was the reply, and the
coach and captain groaned. They had a game with
Fairview in prospect, and must needs win it if
they were to have a chance for the championship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we can&rsquo;t postpone it?&rdquo; asked Holly
dubiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; answered the coach. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have
to play Jackson at quarter. I&rsquo;ll take him in hand
at once. We only have a week, but in that time
the Jersey twin will do better than Moseby, who&rsquo;s
been playing quarter on the scrub. It&rsquo;s the best
we can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil was too sick to accompany the team home,
and Tom volunteered to stay with him for a couple
of days, the coach and captain agreeing to explain
matters at college. So the despondent players returned
to Haddonfield, while Tom remained with
Phil at the hotel. Three days later, thanks to the
skill of the doctor, Phil was able to travel, though
he was quite weak. He was broken-hearted at the
way he had collapsed in the critical part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
game, but Tom would not listen to any of his
chum&rsquo;s self-reproaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make up for it when we play Fairview!&rdquo;
declared Phil. He was in a bad state when told
that he could not play that game, but there was
no help for it.</p>

<p>Ruth called to see her brother, accompanied by
Madge Tyler. He was sitting in the dilapidated
easy chair when the girls came in, and apologized
for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re glad to see you even in that state,
Phil, as long as it&rsquo;s no worse, aren&rsquo;t we, Madge?&rdquo;
spoke Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Madge brightly. &ldquo;I
wish you were better, so you could play Saturday
against our college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d be sure to win, if he did,&rdquo; interposed
Tom. &ldquo;As it is, your fellows have a better
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care if we do lose!&rdquo; exclaimed
Madge, and she blushed prettily. &ldquo;That is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
and she paused in some confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Madge Tyler!&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s treason!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; was the answer, with a toss of
the head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want your brother to get
well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; was all Madge said, and Tom wondered
what she meant.</p>

<p>But Randall did not lose to Fairview in the second
game. It was a hard one, but the Jersey twin
did good work at quarter, and Hayden proved a
&ldquo;star&rdquo; end, making a brilliant run and a touch-down.
The score was seventeen to five, a solitary
field goal being all that Fairview was able to accomplish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now we&rsquo;ll have a chance at the championship,
when we meet Boxer Hall next,&rdquo; said
Phil, who had watched the contest from the grandstand,
though he was as nervous as a colt all the
while.</p>

<p>The &rsquo;varsity quarter-back was allowed to begin
practice the following week, and was soon playing
with his old-time form. In fact, the little rest
seemed to have benefited him, and this, added to
the fact that encouraging news had been received
concerning his mother, made him less apprehensive
when he was on the gridiron. There were two
more rather unimportant games in prospect before
the final contest with Boxer Hall, and all the energies
of the Randall eleven were now turned to the
deciding contest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, you fellows,&rdquo; remarked Sid one sunny
November afternoon, when all three chums were
in the room after lectures, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you want to take
a walk with me? I&rsquo;ve got to do some observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
work in my biology course, and I&rsquo;m going to take
my camera along and make some pictures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you going?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, along the river. Then I&rsquo;ll strike across
country, and fetch up somewhere. We&rsquo;ll not be
gone over three hours, and we&rsquo;ll get back by dark.
Come along; it will do you good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we go with the old gazabo, Phil?&rdquo; asked
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he guarantees not to get us lost in the woods,
so we&rsquo;ll have to stay out all night,&rdquo; replied the
quarter-back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll get you home safe,&rdquo; declared Sid.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a nice walk. I&rsquo;ll be ready in a jiffy,&rdquo;
and he proceeded to load his camera with films.
It was a large one, and he often used it to make
pictures which had a bearing on his class work in
biology and evolution. The three chums were soon
strolling along the banks of the river, Sid on the
lookout for late-staying birds or some animal or
reptile which he might add to his photographic collection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be fond of this sort of thing, to lug
that heavy camera around with you,&rdquo; commented
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Sid. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very interesting to study
the habits of birds and animals. You&rsquo;d ought to
have taken that course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had, instead of mathematics,&rdquo; put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dead sick of them, but I guess I&rsquo;ll
have to stick at &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a mile or more Sid saw nothing on which
to focus his camera. He suggested that they leave
the vicinity of the river and strike across country,
and, as his chums left the matter entirely to
him, this plan was followed. Suddenly, as they
were going through a clump of trees about a mile
from the stream, Sid uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, fellows!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I can get a
beautiful snapshot here,&rdquo; and he motioned them to
stand still, while he got his automatic hand camera
into position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; whispered Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A <i>vulpes pennsylvanicus argentatus</i>!&rdquo; answered
Sid as he turned the focusing screw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, for the love of Mike?&rdquo; spoke
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessed if I know,&rdquo; retorted Phil. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see anything. Maybe it&rsquo;s a snake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fox, you chumps!&rdquo; came from Sid. &ldquo;Keep
still, can&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;ve got him just right. He can&rsquo;t
see me, and the wind is blowing from him to me.
I&rsquo;ll have his picture in a minute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, as bad luck would have it, just as Sid was
about to press the lever, releasing the shutter,
Phil leaned too heavily on one foot. A stick broke
under him with a snap, there was a sudden rustling
in the bushes, and Sid uttered a cry of dismay.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There he goes!&rdquo; cried the naturalist. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter with you fellows, anyhow? Can&rsquo;t you
keep still? Now it will take me an hour to trail
him, and the chances are I can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t my fault,&rdquo; explained Tom. &ldquo;Phil
did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; came from the guilty one.
&ldquo;What do you want to photograph such scary
things as foxes for, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; was Sid&rsquo;s exclamation. &ldquo;Well,
there&rsquo;s no help for it. Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; inquired Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the fox, of course,&rdquo; and Sid started resolutely
forward. Tom and Phil followed for a
short distance, then Phil called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, it&rsquo;s getting swampy here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; asked Sid, whose enthusiasm
would not let him notice such small matters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lots of it,&rdquo; came from Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting
our feet wet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t be babies!&rdquo; retorted Sid, plunging
into a deep, muddy hole. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find a dryer path,&rdquo; said Phil, and
Tom agreed with him. They turned aside, but
Sid kept on. Soon he was lost to sight in the
woods. Phil and Tom looked in vain for a better
route, and, finding none, decided to turn back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait for you out on the main road,&rdquo;
Phil called to his unseen chum. An indistinguishable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
answer came back. The two picked their way
to higher ground, and edged off toward the road
which skirted the woods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Photographing in a swamp is too rich for my
blood,&rdquo; commented Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;But Sid doesn&rsquo;t
seem to mind it. Smoked mackerel, look at my
shoes!&rdquo; and he glanced at his muddy feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in as bad,&rdquo; added Phil. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk
through the grass and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then they heard Sid calling from afar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he saying?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; advised Phil.</p>

<p>Again the cry was heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds as if he was calling for us to come to
him,&rdquo; ventured Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, but I&rsquo;m not going. I&rsquo;m just as well
satisfied to look at the photograph after he&rsquo;s developed
it. I&rsquo;m going to stay here,&rdquo; came from
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>

<p>The cries continued, and then ceased. Tom and
Phil waited nearly an hour for Sid to reappear,
and when he did not come they started back for
college, thinking he had gone another way. But
poor Sid was in dire straits, as we shall soon see.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

<h3>WOES OF A NATURALIST</h3>


<p>Sid Henderson was of a very hopeful disposition,
otherwise he never would have undertaken
to get a picture of that fox after it had once been
alarmed. But he fancied he could trail it to its
burrow, and he wanted very much to get a photograph
of the animal in its home surroundings.</p>

<p>So, unmindful of the desertion of his chums, he
plunged on into the swamp. The footing became
more and more treacherous as he advanced, and
he had to go slowly, looking here and there for
grass hummocks to support him. His camera, too,
was a handicap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to get that fox!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I just need a picture like that. Besides, I may
find in this swamp some material I can use in my
biological experiments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On he went, leaping from hummock to hummock.
Once he nearly slipped and barely saved
himself from falling into a slough of black water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder how deep that is?&rdquo; he remarked, and
taking a dead branch he thrust it straight down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
He found that the hole was deeper than he had
anticipated.</p>

<p>Keeping a sharp lookout for the animal he was
after, he was at length rewarded by a sight of it
slinking along through the bushes. He started forward
eagerly, so eagerly, in fact, that he did not
pick his steps. A moment later he slipped from a
grass hummock and went into the muddy bog, up
to his waist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! Whoop! Help! Here, fellows!
Come here and help me! Bring a fence rail!&rdquo; he
called, for he felt himself sinking down deeper
and deeper.</p>

<p>Tom and Phil heard his cries, but thought he
was only calling to them to come and see some
natural curiosity or view the fox, so they did not
respond. Sid called again and again, but got no
answer. Then he tried to scramble from the bog,
and found it hard work, for he had to hold his
camera high up that it might not get wet.</p>

<p>At last he managed to free his legs from the
sticky mud and reached a comparatively firm place.
But what a plight he was in! Plastered with
swamp-ooze to his waist, he looked like some sewer
laborer. Though he did not know it, his face was
spotted with globules of mud, splashed up in his
struggles to get from the bog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I certainly am in bad,&rdquo; he remarked to
himself. &ldquo;Lucky I put on old clothes. I can&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
get much worse, that&rsquo;s one satisfaction. I might as
well keep on. Maybe I can get that fox now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he continued through the swamp. His speed
was better, for he no longer paused to pick his
steps, but splashed on, careless of the mud and
water. The fever of the chase was in his veins,
and another glimpse of the fox convinced him that
the animal was heading for its burrow. At last,
after a tramp of a mile, Sid was successful, and,
in the fast fading light of the fall day, he snapped
the creature, just as it was entering the hole, when
it turned for a final look at its tireless pursuer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it was worth it all,&rdquo; sighed the naturalist
as he closed up his camera and started for home.
&ldquo;Now I wonder where Phil and Tom are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Remembering that they had called to him that
they would wait out on the road, he took that highway
back to college. On the way he found several
specimens which he needed in his evolution work,
and in thinking about them, and his success in
photographing the fox, he forgot about the plight
he was in. He did not meet his chums, of course,
and it was dusk when he got back to college. The
mud had dried somewhat on his trousers and shoes,
and, incidentally, on his face and hands, for he
had, unconsciously, run his hands over his countenance
once or twice, so that the mud globules had
increased in surface area.</p>

<p>It was a very strange and somewhat disreputable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
figure that entered the west dormitory a little later
and started up the stairs, but Sid did not know that,
having no looking glass at hand.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that Professor Tines was
just leaving the dormitory. He had called to see
one of his pupils who was ill&mdash;a &ldquo;greasy dig&rdquo; student&mdash;to
use the college vernacular to designate a
lad who burned midnight oil over his studies. The
professor having finished his call came upon Sid
in the corridor. The instructor saw before him a
young man, mud covered, carrying a square, black
box, and the countenance, spotted with specimens
of swamp muck, was unfamiliar to him. Professor
Tines at once suspected a student trick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Where are you going?&rdquo; he cried, blocking
the way of Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To my room,&rdquo; answered the luckless naturalist,
who, of course, not appreciating that he was most
effectually disguised, thought that the Latin teacher
had recognized him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your room! What do you mean by such nonsense?
What student put you up to this joke?
Tell me, and I will have him punished at once.
How dare you come in here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;I belong here, Professor Tines,&rdquo; said
Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Belong here? You work on the coal trestle!
Don&rsquo;t tell me! You are covered with coal dust
now! What have you there? Are you going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
to play some trick at the instigation of the freshmen?
I demand an answer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Henderson,&rdquo; went on Sid desperately. &ldquo;I
room here&mdash;with Phil Clinton and Tom Parsons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you trifle with me in this fashion?&rdquo;
demanded the irate Latin instructor. &ldquo;I shall
call the proctor and have you arrested!&rdquo; and he
was so much in earnest that Sid, beginning to appreciate
the state he was in, determined to prove
absolutely that he was himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Tines,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you can knock on
that door there, and ask Clinton and Parsons if
I&rsquo;m not Henderson. I&rsquo;ve been out after a fox, and
I fell in the bog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried the professor. &ldquo;I see it now. You
are trying to play a joke on me, with the aid of
Clinton and Parsons. But you shall all three suffer
for it! I <i>will</i> knock on that door. I <i>will</i>
confront your fellow conspirators with the evidence
of their silly act. Come here,&rdquo; and he placed his
hand on Phil&rsquo;s shoulder and led him toward the
room of the three chums. &ldquo;You shall not trifle
with me!&rdquo; he added fiercely.</p>

<p>Holding Sid firmly by the shoulder with one
hand, Professor Tines with the other knocked loudly
at the portal. Phil and Tom were within, and
the latter quickly opened the door, for the summons
was imperative. The two chums in the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
started back at the sight of the instructor having
in custody the mud-covered figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young gentlemen,&rdquo; began the professor sternly,
&ldquo;this&mdash;this person asserts that he is Henderson,
and that he rooms here. I caught him in the corridor,
and at once detected the joke he was about
to play. He appealed to me to bring him here for
identification. Have you three conspired to play
a trick on me? Is this Henderson or is it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom and Phil stared at the disreputable figure.
They knew at once that it was their chum, but the
spirit of mischief entered into Tom. He nudged
Phil, and then answered promptly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, Professor Tines. We don&rsquo;t
know the person!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he shut the door, while, with a cry of rage
at the desertion of his friends, Sid tried to break
away from the Latin teacher.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

<h3>TOM IS JEALOUS</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Ha! I knew you were up to some trick!&rdquo;
cried Professor Tines. &ldquo;You are no student of
Randall College at all! I&rsquo;ll take you to Proctor
Zane, and he&rsquo;ll give you in charge of an officer!
Perhaps you are a thief, and have stolen that
camera!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid, unable to understand
the action of Tom and Phil. &ldquo;I tell you I am
Henderson, professor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Then how do you account for Parsons
and Clinton failing to identify you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a&mdash;a joke!&rdquo; Sid was forced to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! I knew there was some trick in it! So
you admit you were trying to play a joke on me
in having them identify you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried Sid, alarmed at this misunderstanding.
&ldquo;They were joking when they said I
wasn&rsquo;t Henderson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, who are you, then?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I <i>am</i> Henderson. This is my camera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make it any worse, young man,&rdquo; warned
the teacher sternly. &ldquo;Come with me to the proctor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no help for it, Sid had to go. He
might have broken away from the professor, but
he did not like to try it, for Mr. Tines seemed very
determined, and the ensuing tumult would bring
into the corridor a throng of students, so that Sid
would never hear the last of the joke that had
turned on him. He went along quietly, thankful
that it was dark, and that no one would see him
in the walk across the campus to the proctor&rsquo;s
quarters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is a young man&mdash;a thief, if nothing worse,
perhaps&mdash;whom I caught in the corridor of the
west dormitory,&rdquo; explained Professor Tines to Mr.
Zane a little later as he stood with his quarry before
the proctor. Sid caught a glimpse of himself in a
looking glass in the brightly-lighted office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I&mdash;do I look like that?&rdquo; he gasped as he
saw his slimy trousers, and his face, which was like
unto that of a chimney sweep, his hands also being
covered with the swamp mud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You certainly do!&rdquo; said Professor Tines heartily.
&ldquo;Are you now ready to confess, before we send
for an officer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I tell you I&rsquo;m Henderson!&rdquo; insisted the
luckless Sid. &ldquo;It was only a joke when Phil and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Tom went back on me. I tell you I&rsquo;m Henderson,
of the sophomore class!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The proctor glanced sharply at him. Mr. Zane
had good eyes and a memory for voices, which
Professor Tines lacked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it <i>is</i> Henderson,&rdquo; spoke the proctor
at length. &ldquo;But where in the world have you
been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Photographing a fox,&rdquo; explained Sid, and then
he told the whole story. A dawning light of belief
came into the countenance of Professor Tines, and
when Sid had been allowed to wash his face and
hands, there was no further doubt as to his identity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked the proctor, trying hard not
to laugh as he glanced at the student&rsquo;s mud-encased
trousers, &ldquo;I would advise you to wear rubber boots
when you go on your next nature excursion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; promised Sid. &ldquo;May I go to my room
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; rasped out the Latin instructor.
&ldquo;But&mdash;ahem! I am not altogether sure yet that
you are not up to some mischief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll develop the picture of the fox and show
you!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid eagerly. &ldquo;And here are some
snails I picked up in the swamp,&rdquo; and with that he
plunged his hand into the pocket of his coat and
drew out a lot of the slimy creatures. Some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
them dropped on the floor and started to crawl
away, leaving a shimmering track.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do! The evidence is sufficient, I
think!&rdquo; exclaimed the proctor, who had a horror
of such things. &ldquo;Take them away at once, Mr.
Henderson!&rdquo; And Sid went down on his knees to
gather up the <i>helix molluscæ</i>, while Professor Tines
hurried from the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to see the picture of the fox?&rdquo;
asked Sid as he arose, his hands filled with snails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; answered the proctor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
take your word for it, Mr. Henderson. But please
be more careful,&rdquo; and he looked at the mud spots
on his rug.</p>

<p>A little later Sid burst into the room where his
two chums were pouring over their books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say! What in blazes did you fellows go back
on me that way for?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? He speaks in riddles!&rdquo; said Phil
softly. &ldquo;Why, Siddie,&rdquo; he went on, as a mother
might chide a little boy, &ldquo;wherever have you been?
You&rsquo;re all mud! Oh, such a state as your trousers
are in! Whatever will papa say, Siddie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a dirty beast!&rdquo; cried Tom in simulated
horror.</p>

<p>Poor Sid looked from one to the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you tell Pitchfork I wasn&rsquo;t Henderson?&rdquo;
he demanded savagely.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell Pitchfork you weren&rsquo;t yourself?&rdquo; asked
Phil, as if he had never heard of such a thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; inquired Tom innocently.
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen you since we left you going
after the fox, and we got tired and came home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me,&rdquo; began Sid, &ldquo;that you
didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And then he stopped, at the grins
that appeared on the faces of his chums. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the use?&rdquo; he asked wearily. &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll get
even with you two,&rdquo; he concluded as he put his
camera away and proceeded to change his clothes.
But a little later, when he had developed the picture
of the fox, and found it to be a fine one, he
forgot his anger and the ordeal he had gone
through, for Sid was a true naturalist.</p>

<p>It was approaching the date for the great game
with Boxer Hall, and the football squad was practicing
with a fierce energy; for, more than any other
contest, they wanted to win that one.</p>

<p>The team was fairly &ldquo;on edge and trained to the
second,&rdquo; as Holly Cross said. They had won the
two games that came before the final one, and now
but two weeks elapsed before they would clash with
Boxer Hall on the Randall gridiron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to the <i>Kappa Delta</i> dance?&rdquo;
asked Phil of Tom one night, referring to an annual
affair of one of the Greek letter fraternities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;I think we need something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
like that to get us in shape for the game with
Boxer Hall. You&rsquo;re going, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. Who you going to take?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t quite made up my mind yet. Are you
going with a dame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, if you don&rsquo;t mind me asking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madge Tyler,&rdquo; answered Phil, and he seemed
to be very busy arranging his tie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madge Tyler?&rdquo; repeated Tom quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Any objections?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was silent a moment. He was struggling
with a strange sensation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked Phil, turning and facing his chum&mdash;Sid
was out of the room&mdash;&ldquo;any objections?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; answered Tom slowly. &ldquo;I took
her last term, and&mdash;er&mdash;I was rather counting
on&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were going to take her again this year,&rdquo;
interrupted Phil, &ldquo;but you waited too long. Sorry
I cut you out, old man. No hard feelings, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; answered Tom hesitatingly. &ldquo;Of
course not,&rdquo; he added more genially. &ldquo;I was too
slow, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to ask some one else,&rdquo; went on
Phil. &ldquo;Are you sure you don&rsquo;t mind, old chap?&rdquo;
and he came over and stood beside his chum.</p>

<p>Tom did not answer for a few seconds. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
was a strained quality in his voice when he replied,
as cheerfully as he could:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. You&rsquo;re first in war, first in football,
and first in&mdash;the affairs with the ladies,&rdquo; he
paraphrased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom will you take?&rdquo; persisted Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, as he got up from
the couch and started from the room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
going to the affair, after all,&rdquo; and he slammed the
door as he went out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; whistled Phil. &ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s jealous!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

<h3>A STRANGE DISCOVERY</h3>


<p>The <i>Kappa Delta</i> dance was a brilliant affair.
Phil took Madge, and very charming she looked
in a new gown of&mdash;oh, well, what difference does
it make what her dress was like, anyhow? Besides,
I don&rsquo;t know whether it was bombazine or
chiffon, and the more I try to describe it the worse
I will get tangled, so if you&rsquo;ll take my word for
it, as well as Phil&rsquo;s, who ought to know, she looked
very pretty indeed. The girls said she was &ldquo;sweet,&rdquo;
whatever that means.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Ruth coming?&rdquo; asked Phil of his partner
after the first waltz.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought so,&rdquo; answered Madge slowly.
&ldquo;She was getting ready to come when I left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who with?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Didn&rsquo;t she tell you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She never does,&rdquo; replied Phil. &ldquo;I thought
you&rsquo;d know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I usually do, but this time Ruth was
quite mysterious about it.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There she comes now!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, looking
toward the entrance to the ballroom. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
that with her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see. She&rsquo;s in front&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s Tom&mdash;Tom
Parsons!&rdquo; added Madge quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. &ldquo;The sly beggar! He
was going to take her all the while, yet he pretended
to be jealous because I said I was going to
take&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped in some confusion. Madge looked
at him quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he&mdash;was he jealous about me?&rdquo; she asked
softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He pretended to be,&rdquo; said her partner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only pretended? How ungallant of you!&rdquo; she
cried gaily, yet there was more meaning in her
tones than Phil was aware of. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
say he was madly jealous of me; and that you two
quarreled dreadfully over me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I s&rsquo;pose I could say it,&rdquo; replied Phil
slowly, &ldquo;but you see&mdash;&mdash; Let&rsquo;s try this two-step,&rdquo;
he interrupted, glad of the chance to get out of
an awkward explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to wait and speak to Ruth,&rdquo; said
Madge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Later will do,&rdquo; answered Phil, and they swung
out on the polished floor together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You frowsy beggar, why didn&rsquo;t you tell me you
were going to bring my sister?&rdquo; cried Phil to Tom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
when the two-step finished and the four had come
together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure she&rsquo;d go,&rdquo; replied Tom in a low
voice, and Phil missed the usual friendly note in
his tones. &ldquo;Will you come down and have an ice?&rdquo;
he asked Ruth, and before Phil could say anything
more Tom had led his fair partner away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it all! There&rsquo;s something the matter
with Tom!&rdquo; thought honest Phil as he looked at
Madge. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have it out with him when this affair
is over. We can&rsquo;t let girls come between us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was late when Phil got back to his room, after
taking Madge home. Sid was asleep, and the
quarter-back moved about softly, so as not to disturb
him, for Sid had foresworn such dissipations
as fraternity dances. Just as Phil was about to get
into bed, Tom came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, old man,&rdquo; burst out Phil in a whisper,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matter?&rdquo; asked Tom, as if greatly surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, matter. You&rsquo;ve been different ever since
I told you I was going to take Madge to the dance.
Now, am I trespassing on your preserves? If I
am, say so. But I thought you liked Ruth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought. I knew you used to
go with Madge, but since&mdash;&mdash; Oh, hang it all, I
can&rsquo;t explain&mdash;I&rsquo;m Ruth&rsquo;s brother, you know. But
if you think I want to cut you out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; broke in Tom with a forced
geniality that Phil noticed. &ldquo;Forget it, old man.
Of course, you had a perfect right to go with
Madge. I dare say she&rsquo;d a heap sight rather have
you than me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; interposed Phil;
&ldquo;but I was afraid I was treading on your corns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; repeated Tom quickly. &ldquo;Fine
dance, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very. But are you sure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dry up!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, more like himself.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a letter Ruth gave me to give you.
It&rsquo;s from your mother. Your sister meant to hand
it to you at the dance, but she forgot. Came late
to-night&mdash;or, rather, last night&mdash;it&rsquo;s morning now.
She&rsquo;s a little better, it seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil eagerly. &ldquo;But
I wonder why she didn&rsquo;t write to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t manage but one letter, I believe
Ruth said,&rdquo; went on Tom gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, I wish you fellows would cut out that
gab!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Sid, turning over in bed.
&ldquo;I want to sleep. I don&rsquo;t go out to dances, where
there are a lot of silly girls, and then sit up all
night talking about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out, you grumpy old misogynist!&rdquo; exclaimed
Phil, shying a sofa cushion at his chum.
&ldquo;Wake up and hear the glad tidings of the dance!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad pollywogs!&rdquo; grumbled Sid. &ldquo;Get to bed
and douse the glim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which Phil soon did, as Tom showed no further
inclination to talk.</p>

<p>In spite of Tom&rsquo;s assertions to the contrary,
Phil could not help feeling that a coldness had
sprung up between himself and his chum. That
it was about Madge, Phil could not deny, yet he
hesitated to speak further of it to Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it will work itself out,&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;I hope so, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the time for the final and deciding
championship football game was drawing closer.
Randall and Boxer Hall were easily the two best
teams, not only in the Tonoka Lake League, but
in that section of the country. Neither had done
any remarkable playing, nor could it be said that
their goal line had not been crossed, but the championship
lay between them. The practice was exacting
and constant, and the &rsquo;varsity eleven was &ldquo;as
hard as nails,&rdquo; to again quote my friend, Holly
Cross, who had an extensive sporting vocabulary.
They were eager for the contest.</p>

<p>Tom and Phil, between whom there was still a
shadow of coldness, came walking together from
the gridiron. They were talking about a wing-shift
play that had been tried with some success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the signal for it,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
too complicated, and the other fellows may get on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
to it. I think I can work out a better combination.
I&rsquo;ll use some of the old signal letters and
numbers that we discarded. I&rsquo;ve got a copy of
them in my room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea,&rdquo; commented
Tom. &ldquo;I think, myself, that the signal takes too
long to understand. It ought to be snappier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my idea. We&rsquo;ll see if we can&rsquo;t work out
a better one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurrying from the gymnasium, where they had
changed their clothes, Tom and Phil went to their
room. Sid was there studying. Phil went over
to the wall, where he had placed the new picture
of Madge Tyler she had given him, and took it
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time
you removed some of these flags, banners, ribbons
and other effeminate decorations. Start in, Tom,
on your share. We&rsquo;ll get this room to looking
right, after a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not taking it down,&rdquo; declared Phil as
he removed the photograph from the wall. He
had had it placed in rather a heavy and deep gold
frame. &ldquo;I want to get my copy of the football
signals&mdash;the ones we discarded&mdash;from behind it,&rdquo;
he explained. &ldquo;I hid them there, as being the
place least likely to be disturbed. I&rsquo;m going to
frame up a new signal&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, and looked first from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
picture to the floor, and then from the floor to the
picture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The copy of the signals&mdash;it&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he said
quickly. &ldquo;I had it fastened to the back of the picture
by a bit of wire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; inquired Sid, getting up from
the old easy chair, and making a cloud of dust in
the operation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone&mdash;some
one must have taken the signals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom dimly recalled a certain scene he and Phil
had witnessed, and also remembered the words of
the coach when he had made a shift of the signals.
Phil looked at Tom. He was thinking of the same
thing. Suddenly Phil uttered a cry. From the
deep, curved frame of the picture he held up a
small gold watch-charm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A freshman charm!&rdquo; spoke Sid slowly, as he
recognized the device affected by a certain first-year
secret society.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose is it?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no telling,&rdquo; replied Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is,&rdquo; went on Sid. &ldquo;They always
have their initials on the back of the charm. Look
and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil turned it over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever left this here must have taken the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
copy of the signals,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;He probably
took down the picture and removed the paper. In
doing so the charm slipped from his watch-chain
and fell in the deep frame. He must have held it
about at his belt to bend up the wire, for it was
stiff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose initials are on the back?&rdquo; asked Tom
in a low voice.</p>

<p>Phil looked at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are &lsquo;G. A. G.,&rsquo;&rdquo; he announced.</p>

<p>Sid reached for a college roster, and turned to
the freshman class list. The room was strangely
silent, not even the ticking of the alarm clock being
heard, for it had run down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only fellow with the initials &lsquo;G. A. G.&rsquo;
is Garvey A. Gerhart,&rdquo; answered Sid.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>

<h3>A BITTER ENEMY</h3>


<p>The breathing of the three chums was distinctly
audible in the silence that followed. Varied
thoughts rushed through their minds, but all centered
around the idea that there was a traitor in
college&mdash;some one who would go to extreme
lengths to see the football eleven lose. That this
person was Garvey Gerhart was the belief of Tom,
Phil and Sid. The quarter-back was the first to
break the silence that was becoming strained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cowardly sneak!&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;He ought
to be tarred and feathered and ridden around the
campus on a rail. The dirty cad!&rdquo; Phil clenched
his fists. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to do it, too!&rdquo; he added
fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell what we discovered. I&rsquo;m
going to let Holly Cross and Mr. Lighton know.
It was Gerhart who stole the copy of the signals.
He sneaked in here when we were out and found
them, though how he knew enough to look behind
the picture is more than I understand. Probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
he wanted to see if the girl&rsquo;s name was on the
back, and saw the paper by accident. Anyhow, he
took it, and he lost the charm at the same time,
though he didn&rsquo;t notice it. Then he went and
bargained to sell the signals to Stoddard, of Boxer
Hall. That was when we saw them talking together
down by the bridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Stoddard didn&rsquo;t take his offer,&rdquo; interposed
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; Stoddard isn&rsquo;t that kind of a chap,&rdquo; went
on Phil. &ldquo;He let Mr. Lighton know anonymously.
But what Stoddard did doesn&rsquo;t lessen Gerhart&rsquo;s
guilt. He wanted to throw the team, and only
for the fact that he made his offer to an honest
chap we would have lost the game. I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d like
to smash him into jelly!&rdquo; and Phil fairly shook in
righteous anger, for the team was very dear to his
heart. He felt everything that affected the eleven
more, perhaps, than any other lad in Randall College,
not even excepting the captain, Holly Cross.
So it is no wonder that Phil raged. He started
from the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Sid, interposing
his bulky frame between Phil and the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell the coach and Holly Cross
what I&rsquo;ve discovered. I&rsquo;m going to show them this
charm. I&rsquo;m going to propose that we tar and
feather Gerhart and ride him out of college to the
tune of the &lsquo;Rogues&rsquo; March.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; spoke Sid very quietly.</p>

<p>Phil looked at him for a moment. Then he
burst out with: &ldquo;What do you mean? Don&rsquo;t you
want me to tell? I&rsquo;m going to, I say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; repeated Sid, and he did not
raise his voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to sit right down,&rdquo;
and he gently shoved Phil toward the yawning easy
chair. Puzzled by his chum&rsquo;s action, Phil backed
up, and before he knew it he had flopped down
upon the cushions, raising an unusual cloud of dust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Henderson, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;
he cried, as he struggled to get up. &ldquo;Are you
crazy? Don&rsquo;t interfere with me again! I&rsquo;m going
to inform on the dirty, sneaking cad who wanted
to see his own college beaten!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid put a hand on his chum&rsquo;s shoulder and pushed
him back into the chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to do nothing of the sort, my
son,&rdquo; went on the big first baseman slowly. &ldquo;Tom,
lock the door and put the key in your pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom as though acting under the influence of some
hypnotic spell, obeyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you both crazy?&rdquo; burst out Phil. &ldquo;I tell
you the whole college must know what a white-livered
hound we&rsquo;ve got here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what they mustn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said
Sid quietly. &ldquo;Now listen to me,&rdquo; he went on more
sternly. &ldquo;In the first place, you don&rsquo;t know that
Gerhart is guilty.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know? Of course I know it!&rdquo; almost
shouted Phil. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I got the evidence?&rdquo; and
he held out the charm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy,&rdquo; cautioned Sid. &ldquo;I grant that; I even
grant that the charm is Gerhart&rsquo;s; but does that
prove he took the signals?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It proves that he was in the room,&rdquo; declared
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I admit that. I saw him in here once myself&mdash;just
before that accident to my hand. But
that doesn&rsquo;t prove anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was in here some other time then, when
none of us was here. He must have taken the picture
down, else the charm would never have been
caught in the frame and remained there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Granted; but you are still far from making out
a case, Phil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe he did it?&rdquo; asked the quarter-back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, when it comes to that, but we&rsquo;ve got to
offer more evidence than our own beliefs when it
comes to convincing other people. Besides, I don&rsquo;t
see what need there is of proving your case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think the college ought to know what
sort of a coward and sneak we&rsquo;ve got at Randall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sid decidedly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s just
the point. That&rsquo;s just why I don&rsquo;t want you to
go and tell Holly what we&rsquo;ve found. I think Gerhart
took those signals,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
that when we saw him talking to Stoddard
he was trying to dispose of them to him. But just
because I feel morally certain of it doesn&rsquo;t justify
me in spreading the news broadcast. Besides, do
we want every one to know what a cad we have
here? I take the opposite view from you. I think
we ought not to wash our soiled linen in public.
The more we can hush this thing up the better.
I wouldn&rsquo;t let it get beyond us three. It ought
to stop right here. We would be the laughingstock
of Fairview and Boxer Hall if it got out.
To think that the Randall spirit was capable of
falling so low that there was a traitor among us!
I&rsquo;m glad Stoddard kept still. Evidently he didn&rsquo;t
tell a soul, but warned Lighton privately, and the
team has kept quiet about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Sid earnestly, &ldquo;do you want
to go and publish it? Do you want to let every
one see our shame? I don&rsquo;t believe you do, Phil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil was silent for several seconds. He was
struggling with some emotion. Tom stood with
his back to the door, though it was locked. Sid
stood before his chum, looking anxiously at him
as he sat in the big chair. Then, with a long
breath, Phil said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right, Sid. I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t look at
it that way. I&rsquo;ll keep still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you would,&rdquo; spoke Sid significantly.</p>

<p>Phil put the charm in his pocket. The strain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
was over. They all seemed relieved. But Phil,
so much was his heart bound up in the eleven,
could not forget the great affront that had been
planned against it. Two days later, meeting Gerhart
alone on the campus, he approached him, and
showing the freshman the watch-charm, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care, you dirty coward! We know where
you lost this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerhart started, turned first pale and then red.
He soon recovered himself, and answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you do,&rdquo; snapped Phil. &ldquo;You stole my
signals!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; said Gerhart coolly, and he
walked on.</p>

<p>But if Phil could have seen him a little later,
when he joined Langridge, the quarter-back would
have wondered at the rage and fear shown by the
freshman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clinton knows! He found my charm! I was
afraid I&rsquo;d lost it in his room,&rdquo; said Gerhart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of us has got to leave Randall!&rdquo; exclaimed
Gerhart savagely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s he or I; and it will be
he, if I can accomplish it!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>

<h3>&ldquo;IT&rsquo;S TOO LATE TO BACK OUT!&rdquo;</h3>


<p>Gerhart and Langridge were walking along
the road that led to Haddonfield. The freshman
was filled with unreasoning rage against not only
Phil, but Tom and Sid, as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably all three know,&rdquo; said Gerhart. &ldquo;I
was a fool not to look to see if I left any clues
behind when I was in the room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you were a fool for ever trying that
signal and liniment trick at all,&rdquo; suggested Langridge,
who did not mince words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; admitted his crony. &ldquo;But I thought
I could get back at Clinton, Cross and Lighton, for
not letting me play. Only that Stoddard was such
a white-livered chump I&rsquo;d have pulled off the signal
trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As it was, you lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but the game isn&rsquo;t over yet. There&rsquo;s still
the Boxer Hall contest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;re going to try and
give away the signals in that game, do you?&rdquo; cried
Langridge.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but I&rsquo;m going to keep Clinton out of the
game. If I can do that I&rsquo;ll feel that I&rsquo;m even with
him&mdash;the beast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But can you do it? If you do it, it may make
our team lose, for Clinton is one of the best players,
and it&rsquo;s hard to substitute a quarter-back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do it; and I wish the eleven would lose!
That&rsquo;s what I want to see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got much college spirit,&rdquo; observed
Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve as much as you. Weren&rsquo;t you in with me
on this scheme?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo; Langridge didn&rsquo;t seem to derive
much satisfaction from the admission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you were. You hate Clinton and
his bunch as much as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d like to see &rsquo;em laid out good and
proper, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; hesitatingly, &ldquo;I guess so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you would! Well, you&rsquo;re going to
if you stick to me. I&rsquo;ve got the best plan yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along to town, and you&rsquo;ll see part of it.
I&rsquo;ve got to get certain things, and then I&rsquo;ll be
ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to be careful you don&rsquo;t leave any
evidence after you this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No danger. Will you help me?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess so, as long as it isn&rsquo;t anything rash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t cause any permanent harm to
any one, but it will knock Clinton out from playing
the game, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m after. Now come
on. I want to get to Haddonfield before the college
crowd starts. It won&rsquo;t do to be seen where we&rsquo;re
going, or there might be an inquiry afterward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About an hour later Langridge and Gerhart
were in the telegraph office at Haddonfield. There
might have been noticed about the sophomore a
trace of nervousness as he walked up to the little
window and inquired how long it would take to
get some money from his uncle in Chicago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want it to come by telegraph,&rdquo; Langridge
explained. &ldquo;I need it in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you college chaps usually do,&rdquo; said the
agent. &ldquo;Well, you can get it late to-night, I suppose,
if you send a wire to Chicago now. How
much would you need?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a couple of hundred; maybe five hundred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The agent whistled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than we have on hand here at a
time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have to get it from the bank,
and that couldn&rsquo;t be done until morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no great hurry,&rdquo; went on Langridge.
&ldquo;Would I have to be identified to get it?
My guardian&mdash;that&rsquo;s my uncle&mdash;frequently sends
me money by telegraph when I&rsquo;m off on trips.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; you&rsquo;d have to get some one to vouch
for you,&rdquo; said the agent, &ldquo;but that will be easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I guess I&rsquo;ll telegraph for some,&rdquo; continued
the sophomore, and he began filling out a
blank under the directions of the telegrapher.
Langridge, for a youth who had received money
by wire before, seemed to require minute directions,
and he kept the agent at the window for
several minutes, holding his attention closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, I guess that will do,&rdquo; said the student
at length. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call to-morrow for the cash. Hope
you have it for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll have it if your uncle sends it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sure to do that,&rdquo; retorted Langridge with
a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucky dog!&rdquo; murmured the agent as he turned
back to his desk. &ldquo;Some of those college chaps
have more money than is good for them, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Langridge hurried from the office. He was
joined outside by Gerhart, who had preceded him
out of the door by a few seconds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you get it?&rdquo; asked the sophomore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; was the gleeful answer, and Gerhart
showed several yellow slips. &ldquo;Lucky the door was
unlocked, so I could sneak in. I just took the
blanks and envelopes off his desk when you held
him in conversation. You know, they keep the
receiving blanks in a private drawer, but the sending
ones which you used they leave out where any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
one can reach them. But it&rsquo;s all right now. I&rsquo;ll
soon put it through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I&rsquo;ll get that money?&rdquo; spoke Langridge.
&ldquo;I took a big chance, but it seemed the only
thing to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll get it, and I&rsquo;ll help you spend
it. That&rsquo;s a fair division of labor, as Sam Weller
used to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to do the rest,&rdquo; declared his
crony as they walked back to college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They proceeded in silence. Langridge grew
less and less talkative, and to the jokes of Gerhart,
who seemed in unusually good spirits, he returned
monosyllabic answers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; Gerhart
finally exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you must know,&rdquo; answered Langridge,
&ldquo;the more I think of this the less I like it. It&rsquo;s a
brutal thing to do. I wish I hadn&rsquo;t agreed to help
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have!&rdquo; insisted Gerhart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too
late to back out now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; was the gloomy answer,
and Langridge plodded on behind his crony.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>

<h3>TOM GETS A TIP</h3>


<p>It lacked but two days of the big game with
Boxer Hall. The Randall eleven had bucked
against the scrub until that aggregation of substitutes
was weary, worn and sore. For the &rsquo;varsity
team was now a magnificent fighting machine. The
men played together like clock-work, and were a
joy to the heart of Coach Lighton. As for Holly
Cross, no captain was ever prouder of an eleven
than he was. The ends were fast, the backs could
go through the line for gains every time, guards,
tackles and Snail Looper at center were like a wall
of flesh. The punting, while not all that could be
desired, was good, and several trick plays had been
worked up well nigh to perfection against the scrub.
How they would work against Boxer Hall was
yet to be seen.</p>

<p>But if Randall was in fine shape for the coming
struggle on the gridiron, so was Boxer Hall. Reports
from that institution showed that the eleven
was the best that had been turned out in many a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
season, and by comparing the games played by
Randall (the loss of one game to Fairview and the
winning of the other) and those played by Boxer
Hall against the same teams, an expert would have
been hard put to pick the winner of the championship
struggle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re going to win, fellows!&rdquo; cried Tom
after two halves of hard practice. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we,
Phil, old chap?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; was the rather quiet answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your mother, Phil?&rdquo; asked Holly Cross.
&ldquo;I hope she is getting better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard for two days,&rdquo; replied the
quarter-back, and his face showed a little worry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she must be all right, or your father
would have wired,&rdquo; went on Dutch Housenlager.
&ldquo;My, but I&rsquo;m tired!&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go stale,&rdquo; cautioned the coach. &ldquo;I think
I can let up a bit on you fellows now. We&rsquo;ll have
only light practice to-morrow, and the morning of
the game we&rsquo;ll do some kicking and run through
the signals. Don&rsquo;t forget to listen for the word
to change the system. We may have to do it if
they get on to our curves, so to speak. But I
don&rsquo;t believe they will. And don&rsquo;t forget that the
signals for trick plays have been altered a bit. Also
remember the tip for the sequence plays. I depend
on them for at least one touch-down. Now
amuse yourselves some quiet way to-night. Get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
to bed early, and sleep well. I hope none of you
have any lessons to worry over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not let study worry us, no matter what
happens, until after the game!&rdquo; cried Grasshopper
Backus. &ldquo;Wow! But what a celebration there&rsquo;ll
be if we win! The baseball championship, and
then the football on top of it! Wow!&rdquo; and Grasshopper
gave a leap into the air to show how exuberant
he felt. But Dutch Housenlager slyly put out
his foot, and Grasshopper went down in a heap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll punch your head for that, Dutch!&rdquo; he cried,
springing up; but Dutch, in spite of his bulk, was a
good runner, and got away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose you gladiators are all ready
for the fray,&rdquo; spoke Sid that evening, when Phil
and Tom were in the room, one on the sofa and
the other curled up in the easy chair. Sid was
stretched out on his bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready to do or die,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;I hope
it&rsquo;s a nice day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t mind playing in the rain, do
you?&rdquo; asked Sid. &ldquo;I thought you chaps were
regular mudlarks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we are,&rdquo; went on Tom. &ldquo;Only I want to
see a good crowd out. It&rsquo;s more enthusiastic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what you want,&rdquo; declared Sid. &ldquo;You
want a lot of girls from Fairview Institute to be
on hand. And, what&rsquo;s more, you want some particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
girl to see you make a star play. So does
Phil, I&rsquo;ll wager.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, from what I hear there will be a good
crowd of Fairview girls to see the game,&rdquo; said
Phil. &ldquo;Fairview is sore at being walloped twice
by Boxer Hall, and the co-eds want to see us put
it all over that crowd. So they&rsquo;ll be on hand to
cheer us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;Ruth told me,&rdquo; went on Phil. &ldquo;Oh, it
will be a glorious occasion! Don&rsquo;t you wish you
were playing, Sid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for a minute! Baseball for mine! When
I want to wallow in the mud and get my mouth
and ears full of it, I know an easier way than playing
football.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; go out with a camera and get stuck in the
swamp!&rdquo; cried Tom, and he got up, ready to dodge
any missile which Sid might heave at him in revenge
for having his misadventure recalled. But
the naturalist only answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. I got the best picture of a
fox you ever saw. The mud will come off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re a hopeless case!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil
as he got up and began to change his clothes, laying
out a particularly &ldquo;sporty&rdquo; necktie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom in some surprise.
&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out,&rdquo; replied his chum noncommittally.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were told to stay in and take it
easy to-night,&rdquo; said Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going to any exciting place,&rdquo;
came from Phil as he struggled with a stiff collar.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in early.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to town?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not Haddonfield.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s going to see some girl!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sid. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got perfume on his handkerchief, and
he never wears that tie unless there&rsquo;s a damsel in
the offing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind admitting that there is a
young lady in the case,&rdquo; spoke Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
call on my sister, and you can put that in your pipe
and smoke it, you hard-shelled old misogynist!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so!&rdquo; cried Sid. &ldquo;I knew it. But tell
that yarn about your sister to your grandmother.
It&rsquo;s somebody else&rsquo;s sister you&rsquo;re going to see.
You&rsquo;d never tog up like this for your own sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; admitted Phil coolly as he finished
dressing.</p>

<p>As he stooped over to lace his shoes an envelope
fell from his pocket. Tom picked it up and handed
it to him. He could not help seeing the address,
and, with something like a start, he noticed that
it was in the handwriting of Madge Tyler. He
handed it to Phil without a word, and he noticed
that a dull red crept up under the bronze skin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
his chum&rsquo;s face. But Phil shoved the note into
his pocket and made no comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to see her&mdash;Madge,&rdquo; thought Tom,
and he tried to struggle against the bitter feeling
that seemed to well up in his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave the door unlocked,&rdquo; was Phil&rsquo;s parting
injunction as he went out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in early.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls, girls, girls!&rdquo; grumbled Sid as he rolled
over to a more comfortable position. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
hanged if I room with you fellows next term if
you don&rsquo;t go a bit easier on this dame question.
You don&rsquo;t give me any attention at all. It&rsquo;s all
football and the ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will soon be over,&rdquo; murmured Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which; football or the ladies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Football,&rdquo; was the answer, given with a laugh.</p>

<p>Sid was asleep when Phil came quietly in, but
Tom was wide awake. Still, he said nothing as
Phil went about, getting ready for bed, and when
his chum came close to him, Tom shut his eyes
and feigned slumber. There was something coming
between Tom and Phil. Both realized it, yet
neither liked to broach the subject, for it was a
delicate one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how was your sister?&rdquo; asked Sid pointedly
of Phil the next morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Phil calmly. &ldquo;By the way,
Tom, she was asking for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Tom, and there was coldness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
in his tones. He did not wait for Phil to go to
lectures with him after chapel, but hurried off alone,
and Phil, feeling humiliated, wondered if he had
done or said anything to hurt Tom&rsquo;s feelings. Tom
took care to keep out of Phil&rsquo;s way all that day,
and when the last practice was over, save for some
light work the morning of the game, the left-end
hurried to his room. As he entered it he saw a
note thrust under the door. He picked it up. It
was addressed to him, and an odd feature of it
was that the letters were all printed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who brought this here?&rdquo; he asked of Sid,
who was studying his biology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know anybody had brought anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one shoved this note under the door for
me,&rdquo; went on Tom, ripping open the missive. He
could not repress a start as he read, in the same
printed letters that were on the envelope, this
message:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;There is danger threatening Phil Clinton.
Watch for it.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; spoke Tom slowly, as he tore the
note into bits and tossed them into a basket. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
just a tip, that&rsquo;s all, but I guess it doesn&rsquo;t amount
to anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked over to the old sofa and sat down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
His brain was in a whirl. What danger could
threaten Phil? Whence had come the mysterious
warning?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t amount to anything,&rdquo; thought Tom.
&ldquo;If it had, who ever sent it would have signed his
name. It&rsquo;s meant as a joke. I&rsquo;ll pay no attention
to it. I&rsquo;ll not tell Phil. It might worry him.
Besides, I guess he can look out for himself,&rdquo; and
Tom shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>Ah, Tom, would you have said that but for what
had happened in the last few weeks? But for the
fact that Phil and a certain pretty girl had become
fast friends? Tom felt those questions arising in
his mind, but he put them resolutely from him.
He did not want to answer them. He went over
to the basket and carefully picked out the torn
bits of the note. He thrust them into his pocket.
Sid watched him curiously, but said nothing. He
thought the note was from some girl.</p>

<p>Phil came in a little later. Tom was busy studying,
and hardly looked up; nor did he say anything
about the warning he had so mysteriously received.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>

<h3>&ldquo;LINE UP!&rdquo;</h3>


<p>Out upon the gridiron they trotted; a mass of
lads in suits which showed contact with mother
earth many times, and which, in places, were
marked with blood-stains. The eleven were as full
of life as young colts, and some in their exuberance
leaped high in the air, putting their hands on the
shoulders of their mates. Others turned somersaults,
and some gave impromptu boxing exhibitions.</p>

<p>From the grandstand burst a mighty cheer as
the Randall supporters greeted their team. The
spontaneous shout was followed by the booming of
the Randall college cry. Then Bean Perkins, with
wild waves of his arm, signaled for the &ldquo;Rip &rsquo;Em
Up!&rdquo; song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a crowd!&rdquo; murmured Tom as he walked
beside Phil. &ldquo;I never saw such a bunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s a good mob,&rdquo; answered Phil, but
somehow there was a note of indifference in his
voice. He had not failed to notice Tom&rsquo;s recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
change of demeanor, and it hurt him. Yet he was
too proud to speak of it, or ask the reason, though,
perhaps, he may have guessed what caused it.</p>

<p>As for Tom, the words of the mysterious warning
rang in his ears. Several times he was on the
point of speaking to Phil, but he feared he would
be laughed at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; thought Tom. &ldquo;I guess all that
it amounts to is that some one has heard a rumor
that there&rsquo;ll be an attempt on the part of some
Boxer Hall players to knock Phil out. They may
think they can cripple him and, without him, our
team will go to pieces. But I&rsquo;ll be on the watch
for any dirty playing, and if I catch any one at
it I&rsquo;ll smash him. I&rsquo;ll do my best to keep Phil
from getting hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, if Tom had only known, it was a different
sort of danger that threatened his friend.</p>

<p>Once more the cheers rang out, the shrill voices
of the girls forming a strange contrast to the hoarse
voices of the boys and men. For there were many
men present, &ldquo;old grads,&rdquo; who had come to do
honor to Randall, and many others who came,
hoping to see Boxer Hall win. Women there were,
too; and girls, girls, girls! It seemed that all the
pretty students of Fairview Academy were there.
They were waving flags and bunches of ribbon&mdash;their
own college colors mingled with those of Randall,
for Fairview was on the side of Randall to-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
in retaliation for a severe drubbing Boxer Hall
had administered to the co-educational institution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is your sister here?&rdquo; asked Tom of Phil.
He had meant to ask if Madge was present, but
somehow the words would not come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied his chum. &ldquo;She and Madge are
over in the A section,&rdquo; and he motioned with his
arm to a certain portion of the grandstand. Tom
looked, hoping he might distinguish two girls out
of a crowd of several hundred. Of course, he could
not, and his attention was suddenly called away
from this by the sharp voice of the coach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch some punts, Parsons!&rdquo; called Mr.
Lighton. &ldquo;After that we&rsquo;ll line up for practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Randall eleven was lining up when the
Boxer Hall team fairly burst from their dressing-rooms
under the east grandstand. What a roar
went up as they appeared on the white-marked
field! The burst of yells seemed fully to equal the
jumble of noise that had been made by the Randallites.
For all of Boxer Hall was on hand to
cheer mightily for their eleven, and the college was
a slight favorite over Randall, who, in years past,
had not been known to do anything remarkable on
the gridiron.</p>

<p>Encased in their clumsy garments, the Boxer
players looked like young giants, and when they
lined up and ran through several formations they
did it with the precision of clock-work.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve improved a heap,&rdquo; was the somewhat
dubious remark of Holly Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So have we!&rdquo; exclaimed the coach heartily.
&ldquo;We beat them once, and we can do it again. Get
that idea into your mind and don&rsquo;t let go of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll be all right if Clinton doesn&rsquo;t have
to get out of the game,&rdquo; spoke the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? Do you think he&rsquo;ll be hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe. Boxer Hall sometimes plays a
dirty game, and we&rsquo;ll have to be on the watch. I
wish you&rsquo;d warn the umpire to look out for holding
in the line and slugging. They may do it. They&rsquo;d
go to almost any length to win this game. They
don&rsquo;t want to lose the championship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re going to!&rdquo; exclaimed the coach.
&ldquo;But about Clinton; you don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s any more
likely to be hurt than any other player&mdash;nor as
much, do you? He&rsquo;s well protected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know; but Phil hasn&rsquo;t been himself for
the last two days. I don&rsquo;t know what it is that&rsquo;s
bothering him, but it&rsquo;s something. He doesn&rsquo;t say
anything. First I thought it might be a scrap he&rsquo;d
had with Tom, but they&rsquo;re such good friends I
didn&rsquo;t give that much concern. Then I imagined
he might be worrying about his mother, but he
told me yesterday that the chances for a successful
operation were good. I don&rsquo;t know what it is,
but he&rsquo;s certainly not himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you imagine too much!&rdquo; declared Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Lighton with a laugh. &ldquo;Clinton is all right. He&rsquo;s
a plucky lad. He&rsquo;ll play as long as he can stand.
Look at that game with Wescott.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know; but I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you stop worrying. You&rsquo;re as bad as a
girl. But I guess it&rsquo;s almost time to begin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Song after song came from the supporters of the
rival colleges. The grandstands were packed to
their capacity, and looked like some vast chessboard
with many colored squares, the dark garments
of the boys mingling with the gay dresses
and hats of the girls, and the many-hued ribbons
and flags waving over all.</p>

<p>Captain Cross met and shook hands with Captain
Stoddard, of Boxer Hall, preliminary to the
toss-up. They were to play similar positions&mdash;full-back.
The coin was sent spinning into the air,
and Captain Stoddard won. He elected to defend
the south goal, which gave the ball to Randall
to kick off. The referee, umpire and linesmen held
a final consultation. Captain Cross gathered his
men together for a word of encouragement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve got to say,&rdquo; he remarked simply, &ldquo;is
to play until you can&rsquo;t play any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; added the coach. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t
forget about the possibility of a change in signals
being made in the middle of play; nor about the
sequences. I&rsquo;ll depend on you for that, Clinton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; responded Phil.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>The field was slowly being cleared of stragglers.
The newspaper reporters were getting their paper
and pencils ready, and photographers, with their
big box-cameras, were snapping individual players
as a sort of practice for catching lightning-like
plays later on.</p>

<p>Across the field, toward the group of Randall
players, came a lad. He walked as if undecided
as to his errand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get back,&rdquo; warned Holly Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a message for a feller named Clinton!&rdquo;
cried the lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he is over there,&rdquo; and Holly, who was
in conversation with the coach, pointed at Phil.
The latter started as he took the envelope from
the messenger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who gave you this?&rdquo; asked the quarter-back
huskily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feller outside. Give me a half a dollar fer
bringin&rsquo; it in. Any answer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; replied Phil. His bronze face was
strangely white as he tore the envelope and hastily
read the few words on the paper within. He
seemed to sway, but, with a catch of his breath, he
recovered his composure. He read the message
again. A mist seemed to come before his eyes.
He murmured to himself: &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t tell them&mdash;until
after the game&mdash;I&mdash;I must play the game
out. But&mdash;but can I?&rdquo; He clenched his hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and his jaw became more square with the force of
his teeth closing tightly together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any answer?&rdquo; asked the lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Phil in a low voice, and he crushed
the telegram in his hand, and thrust the rustling
paper inside his jacket.</p>

<p>The lad turned to go, anxious to get a place
where he could view the game. None of Phil&rsquo;s
companions seemed to have noticed that he had
received a message. He looked around at his
chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to play the game,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

<p>The next instant the whistle blew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Line up!&rdquo; came the cry, and Snail Looper,
holding the new yellow ball, placed it on a little
mound of earth ready for the kick-off.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV</a></h2>

<h3>THE GAME</h3>


<p>With a mighty swing of his foot Snail Looper
sent the ball well into Boxer territory. Lamson,
their right half-back, caught it in his arms, and,
with a good defense, began to rush back with it.
Over the chalk-marks he came, but Tom Parsons
was rushing toward him, and dodging through the
intervening players he made a vicious tackle, bringing
Lamson to the ground with a thud on Boxer&rsquo;s
thirty-eight-yard line. There was a quick line-up,
and Stoddard, the full-back, made a good try to
encircle Joe Jackson at right end. But the Jersey
twin and his mates piled up on the mass of Boxer
players with such good effect that hardly three
yards were gained; and at this showing of the
defense of Randall a punt was decided on.</p>

<p>Pinstock, Boxer&rsquo;s left half-back, made a magnificent
drive, and Holly Cross had to skip nimbly back
to catch it. But once he had the pigskin in his
grasp he eluded the Boxer ends, and was well toward
the center of the field before he was downed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Our ball!&rdquo; cried Tom gleefully, and then there
came the chance for Randall to show what she
could do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Signal!&rdquo; cried Phil, and his companions wondered
at the odd note that had crept into his voice.
It was not of the confident style of orders that the
quarter-back was wont to give. But, as the string
of numbers and letters came rattling out, Phil, in
a measure, recovered control of himself. He gave
the word for Kindlings to take the ball at Boxer&rsquo;s
left-end, and smash! into the line went the brawny
right half-back. He gained ten yards so quickly
that Boxer Hall was fairly stunned, and when
Holly Cross ripped out eight yards additional the
crowd of Randall supporters were in a mad frenzy
of delirious joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swat &rsquo;em! Swat &rsquo;em! We have got &rsquo;em!&rdquo;
howled Bean Perkins, and forth from hundreds of
throats came booming that song.</p>

<p>Grasshopper Backus and Dutch Housenlager
opened a great hole between their opposite guard
and tackle, and into this breach Jerry Jackson was
pulled and hurled for several yards, until he fell
under a crushing weight of husky players at Boxer&rsquo;s
thirty-yard-line. Once more Phil&rsquo;s voice sang
out in a signal, and back he snapped the ball to
Holly Cross, who, like some human battering ram,
went through for five yards more. It looked as if
Randall was going right down the field for a touch-down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and Bean Perkins and his cohorts rendered
the &ldquo;Down the Line&rdquo; song with good effect.</p>

<p>A touch-down might have resulted from the
next play, but unfortunately for Randall Jerry Jackson
made a fumble, and in their anxiety several of
his mates held in the line. There was a prompt
penalty enforced, and back to the forty-yard line
the pigskin was taken, where it was turned over to
Randall for another try. Randall&rsquo;s hard work
had not gained her much, and there was an ominous
silence on the part of the cheering throng.
Once more came rushing tactics, and they succeeded
so well that in two downs the ball was carried
to Boxer&rsquo;s thirty-yard line. Then Holly Cross
decided to try for a field goal, but the wind carried
it to one side, and his mates groaned. So did Bean
Perkins and his comrades.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a shame!&rdquo; exclaimed Madge Tyler
to Ruth Clinton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Madge!&rdquo; answered Ruth. &ldquo;I want to
watch the game. I can&rsquo;t talk. I want to see what
Phil does. I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll be hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you worried about Tom Parsons, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;of course. Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth looked at her friend sharply, but there was
no time for further talk, as Boxer had brought out
the ball to their twenty-five-yard line, and elected
to line up with it instead of punting. At Randall&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
line they came, smashing with terrific force, but
so well did Holly and his players hold that only
four yards were made. Another attempt brought
even less gain, and then Boxer had to kick. Kindlings
saw the ball coming toward him, and managed
by a desperate effort, to get it in his arms.
Back he rushed to the forty-three-yard line, where
he fell under a human mountain.</p>

<p>The first play tried by Randall after this was a
forward pass, and the ball went out of bounds.
Holly Cross kicked a twisting punt, and when
Lamson, the Boxer right half, caught it, Tom Parsons
downed him almost in his tracks, so swiftly
did the left-end get down under the kick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go through &rsquo;em!&rdquo; implored Captain Stoddard
to his men, and at the line they came smashing with
crushing force. For the first time since the play
had begun Randall seemed to give way. Holes
were torn in her line, and through the openings the
backs came rushing. They had gained fifteen
yards, in almost as good style as had Randall in
the initial play, when they varied the smashing
work by a try around Tom&rsquo;s end. But he was alert,
and got his man in the nick of time. Another try
at center failed to result in a gain, and Boxer Hall
had to kick.</p>

<p>Jerry Jackson rushed the ball back for a good
distance, and then, with a fierceness that the Boxer
Hall lads could not seem to withstand, Randall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
came at their line, going through for substantial
gains on every try.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff! That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; cried Dutch
Housenlager during a breathing spell, when one of
the Boxer Hall players had to be walked about to
recover his wind. &ldquo;Eh, Phil? Aren&rsquo;t we putting
it all over them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess so,&rdquo; answered Phil, and he passed
his hand over his head as if he was dazed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody hit you?&rdquo; asked Tom, blaming himself
for not having kept a closer watch over his
chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no; I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The injured player limped back into line, and
the game went on. Smash! bang! came the Randall
players, and they went up to the ten-yard line
with scarcely a stop. In vain did the cohorts of
Boxer Hall implore them to brace. It seemed that
they could not. But, just as it looked for all the
world as if the ball would be carried over by Holly
Cross, for it was decided to smash through and
not kick, the brace did come, and the Randall players
had to give up the pigskin. In a jiffy Captain
Stoddard had punted out of danger. There was
an exchange of kicks, and it ended with Boxer
getting the ball on her forty-yard line.</p>

<p>Then, all at once, a new spirit seemed infused
into her players. They came at Randall with a
viciousness that argued well for their spirit. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
was rough work, not noticeable, perhaps, but Tom
felt that what he feared was about to happen; that
some plan was afoot to injure Phil. He played in
as far as he dared, but the opposite end was constantly
drawing him out.</p>

<p>At the line came Lamson, the Boxer right-half.
He ripped out five yards, bowling over Sam Looper
with such force that the Snail had to have a little
medical treatment. He barely recovered in the two
minutes, and was a bit wobbly when the attack
was again directed at him. But Holly Cross and
Jerry Jackson leaped in to his aid, and stopped
the advance. Then Boxer went around right-end,
and had ten yards before they were stopped.
The game looked to be going the other way now,
and there were strained looks on the faces of the
Randall players and their supporters. As for the
cheering contingent of Boxer Hall, they made the
air ring with their song: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Time We Did a
Little Business Now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em get through you. Hold &rsquo;em!
Hold &rsquo;em!&rdquo; cried Holly. &ldquo;Brace up, boys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Randall tried to, but Boxer had found a weak
place between Snail Looper and Grasshopper
Backus, and kept hammering away at it, until they
had advanced the ball to the fifteen-yard line.
Then Boxer Hall played a neat trick. There was
every indication that a try for a field goal was about
to be made, and Holly Cross got back. Instead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
there was a double pass, and a play between tackle
and right-end. Through the Randall line burst
Frothon, the right-tackle, with the ball tucked
under his arm. Holly Cross saw him just in time,
and made a dive for him. But the Randall full-back&rsquo;s
foot slipped, and he went down, making a
vain grab for Frothon, who sped on, and planted
the ball behind the goal posts. Boxer Hall had
made the first touch-down, and the crowd of supporters
went wild, while there was corresponding
gloom on the grandstands where Randallites were
gathered. The goal was missed, and a scrimmage
had hardly begun after the next kick-off before the
whistle blew. The half was up.</p>

<p>What a buzz of excitement there was in the
grandstands! Every one seemed talking at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was hard lines,&rdquo; remarked Ford Fenton
to Sid, next to whom he was sitting. &ldquo;If our fellows
had only been a little quicker then, this would
never have happened. My uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fenton!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid so fiercely that Ford
almost turned pale, &ldquo;if you mention &lsquo;uncle&rsquo; again
during this game, I&rsquo;ll throw you off the grandstand,&rdquo;
and, as Fenton was rather high up, he concluded
to keep quiet.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV</a></h2>

<h3>VICTORY&mdash;CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>There was despondency in the quarters of the
Randall players, where they gathered between the
halves. Gloom sat upon the brow of every one,
and the cheery words of the coach could not seem to
dispel it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one touch-down against you,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;You always play better uphill than down.
Go at &rsquo;em now, and tear them apart! They play
a fierce game, but you can play a fiercer! Are any
of you hurt? How about you, Looper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right now. It was only my wind.
I&rsquo;ve got it back. They won&rsquo;t get through me
again,&rdquo; declared the Snail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not. You&rsquo;re too fat; that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the
trouble. How are you holding out, Clinton?&rdquo; and
the coach turned anxiously to the quarter-back.
Phil was pacing up and down the dressing-room.
There was a strained look on his face, and his hand
was inside his blouse, where his fingers touched a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
crumpled paper. He did not seem to have heard
Mr. Lighton&rsquo;s question. The coach repeated it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? Why, I&mdash;I guess I can last the game
out,&rdquo; said Phil slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last the game out? Why, are you hurt?&rdquo;
The coach was a bit disturbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Of course not. It was just my way of
speaking. It&rsquo;s all right&mdash;it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; and Phil
resumed his pacing of the narrow quarters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess he feels that we&rsquo;re going to lose,&rdquo; whispered
Dutch Housenlager to Tom. But Tom
shook his head. There was something else the
matter with Phil, and he wondered what it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;re on to our signals?&rdquo; asked
Holly Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Phil shortly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to
change them. I&rsquo;ll use the same ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s almost up,&rdquo; remarked the coach, looking
at his watch for about the fifth time within
two minutes.</p>

<p>To the lads it seemed as if they had not had
more than a minute&rsquo;s respite, but they were ready
for the fray again, and there was an eagerness in
the manner in which they leaped out on the gridiron
which betokened that snappy playing would
follow.</p>

<p>Nor was it long in coming. When Boxer Hall
kicked off, amid the chorus of a spirited song,
Kindlings caught the ball, and came back with it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
on such a rush, and so well protected by his teammates,
that he got past the center of the field
before he was downed. Then at the line went the
Randall lads. Smashing through it, there was
no stopping them. Right up the field they came,
surprising even their own coach by their steady
advance. Phil was handling the players with a skill
he had never shown before. Play after play he
called for, and the lads responded with vim. Even
a risky on-side kick was tried and was successful.
Then a forward pass netted fifteen yards, and with
joy in their hearts the Randall lads saw themselves
approaching their opponent&rsquo;s goal-line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, play like Trojans!&rdquo; cried Phil
heartily, this being the signal for four sequence
plays. They were ripped off one after the other,
so quickly that, as Holly Cross said, &ldquo;it made the
hair of the Boxers stand up.&rdquo; For, almost before
the visitors were aware of it, though they tried their
best to stem the human tide, the ball was only a
few feet from the line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Touch-down! Touch-down! Touch-down!&rdquo;
implored the cheering throng.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Touch-down it shall be!&rdquo; whispered Phil fiercely,
and he snapped the ball to Holly Cross, who
went through like a battering ram. There was a
mass of players on top of him, the ball and the
line. Not until they got up could it be seen if the
pigskin was over. The referee rushed in. Slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the players disentangled. The ball was over the
line!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Touch-down!&rdquo; fairly screamed Tom Parsons.
&ldquo;Touch-down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His cry was echoed from the Randall grandstands,
and Dutch Housenlager began a dance
around the team, carrying Holly Cross, Grasshopper
and the Jersey twins with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kick the goal, and we&rsquo;ll be one point ahead
of them!&rdquo; cried Bricktop Molloy to Holly. &ldquo;Put
all the power ye have to spare into your toe, me
lad, and boost the ball over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; promised the captain, but the wind
had increased, and the pigskin struck the bar and
bounded back. But the score was tied, and Randall
felt that she was coming into her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fast and snappy play, now!&rdquo; called Phil Clinton,
and once more he passed his hand over his
head. There was an air of desperation about him,
and Tom noticed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s feeling sick,&rdquo; he thought, and he
hurried over to his chum and asked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel just right,&rdquo; answered Phil. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;m not sick. I&rsquo;m all right. Don&rsquo;t say anything.
We&rsquo;re going to win. We&rsquo;re going to win!&rdquo; he
repeated fiercely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to run the team to
another touch-down. After that&mdash;after that,&rdquo; he
faltered&mdash;&ldquo;well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, after that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ball was kicked off. An exchange of punts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
followed the scrimmage, and Boxer Hall got the
ball. Her players began some good work, but
Randall was ready for it. Several of the best men
were tackled so hard, though not unfairly, that
time had to be taken out for them to recover. Then
Pinstock had to retire because of a twisted ankle,
but, to offset this, Jerry Jackson was knocked out
and Everet took his place.</p>

<p>For a few minutes it seemed as if Boxer Hall
was going up the field for another touch-down, but
Randall braced in time. Then a sudden change
appeared to come over Phil. He had been playing
for all he was worth, but now he seemed a perfect
whirlwind as he called snappily to his men to take
the ball through. And they did it. Through holes
torn first on one side between tackle and guard, or
guard and center, and then on the other wing,
Everet, Holly Cross or Kindlings butted their way.
Phil varied this with some end runs and then called
for his favorite play, the fake right-half back and
tackle shift, when Kerr took the ball on the fly
and went through the opposite side of his opponents&rsquo;
line with it. The play netted fifteen yards,
and placed the ball on Boxer Hall&rsquo;s twenty-yard
line.</p>

<p>The time was fast drawing to a close. Could
Boxer hold the line sufficiently to prevent Randall
from scoring again, making the game a tie? Or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
could Randall break through? Those were the
questions every one was asking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows, for the &lsquo;Conquer or Die&rsquo; song,&rdquo;
called Bean Perkins, and during a silence that followed
a brief consultation between Phil and Holly
Cross there welled out over the gridiron the inspiring
strains of &ldquo;<i>Aut Vincere Aut Mori</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Signal!&rdquo; cried Phil, and he gave one for a forward
pass. He got the ball off in good shape, but
Nottingham, the burly guard of Boxer Hall, broke
through, and jumped right at the quarter-back,
hoping to break up the play. Phil went down
under him, and when Kindlings had been stopped,
after a few yards&rsquo; advance, the quarter-back did
not get up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phil&rsquo;s hurt!&rdquo; cried Tom, and his heart reproached
him for keeping quiet about the warning.
&ldquo;That was done on purpose!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="#image04">There was a rush to where Phil lay</a>. Nottingham
was bending over him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 382px;">
<a name="image04" id="image04"><img src="images/image04.jpg" width="382" height="600" alt="There was a rush to where Phil lay" title="There was a rush to where Phil lay" />
</a><br /><span class="caption">&ldquo;<a href="#Page_292">There was a rush to where Phil lay</a>&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove, old man!&rdquo; he exclaimed contritely.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you. Hope I didn&rsquo;t tackle
you too hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He began rubbing Phil&rsquo;s hands. Holly Cross
passed his fingers over the quarter-back&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He got a nasty bump!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Bring
some water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cold fluid revived the injured lad. He
struggled to get up.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lie still!&rdquo; insisted the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; replied Phil, though
faintly. &ldquo;My head hit a stone, I guess. Give me
a little water, and I&rsquo;ll go on with the game!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got pluck!&rdquo; exclaimed Nottingham admiringly,
but neither he nor any of the others knew
the full extent of the quarter-back&rsquo;s pluck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
awfully sorry, old man,&rdquo; went on Nottingham, who
was one of the best fellows in the world. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
mean to come at you so hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; spoke Phil gently, and he
tried to smile. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to beat you for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got to his feet inside the required two minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Signal!&rdquo; he cried, but there was lacking in his
tones some of his old-time vigor. He called for
a play between guard and tackle. Right at Nottingham
the play was directed, and Dutch Housenlager
was to make it&mdash;big Dutch, who seemed to
be all bone, muscle and sinew. A gleam was in
Phil&rsquo;s eyes as he gave the last letter of the signal.</p>

<p>There were but four yards to go to make a touch-down.
Could Randall do it? &ldquo;They must do it!
They would do it!&rdquo; Phil was deciding for the
whole team. He felt that they must make that
distance, if he had to carry the entire eleven on
his shoulders. Snail Looper was about to snap
the ball back. Boxer Hall was bracing as she
had never braced before. It was now or never. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Randall got a second touch-down it would mean
practically that she would win the game and the
championship.</p>

<p>Back came the ball. Phil passed it to Dutch,
and up against the solid wall of flesh went the big
right-tackle. You could almost hear the impact
over in the grandstand. Behind him were his
mates. In front of him, pulling and hauling on
him, were more of them. On either side were
the Boxer Hall players, who had been torn from
their places to make a hole. From either side
they came leaping in to stop the gap&mdash;to stop the
advance of the man with the ball. On and on
struggled Dutch. He felt that he was not himself&mdash;that
he was but a small part of that seething,
struggling mass&mdash;an atom in a crushing, grinding,
whirling, heaving, boiling caldron of human
beings. Breaths were coming short and quick, eyes
were flashing. It was push and shove, haul, slip,
stumble. Player was piled on player. Tom Parsons
and the other ends were on the outside.
Holly Cross was pushing and shoving, glad if he
felt the mass in front of him give but the fraction
of an inch.</p>

<p>Then, from somewhere beneath that mass of
humanity, came the voice of Dutch Housenlager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down!&rdquo; he called faintly.</p>

<p>The heaving human hill slowly settled down, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
when the fire is withdrawn from under a boiling
kettle.</p>

<p>The whistle blew. Slowly the mass was disintegrated.
Sore, bruised, scratched; bleeding some
of them, lame most of them, desperately anxious
all of them, the players fell apart. Dutch was
lying on his face, his big back arched. The ball
was not to be seen. Had there been a fumble?
The goal line passed beneath the stomach of the
big tackle. Slowly he arose, and then such a shout
as rent the air.</p>

<p>For the ball was under him! It was over the
line! He had made the touch-down!</p>

<p>Oh, how the stands vibrated with the yells, the
cheers, the songs, the delirious leaping up and
down, the stamping of feet and the clapping of
hands! How the Fairview girls shrilly screamed
their college cry! How it was caught up, swallowed
and silenced by the booming cheers from
the Randall cohorts!</p>

<p>For Randall had won. Even if she could not
kick the goal, she had won, as there remained but
one minute more of play. But the goal was kicked.
Holly Cross saw to that, and then, with a final,
useless kick-off, and after the final whistle had
blown, the Randall players gathered together, their
arms about each other, and cheered heartily and
mightily for the victory.</p>

<p>Dutch was hoisted to the shoulders of his mates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
protestingly, and carried about. The Boxer Hall
eleven was cheered, and they gave back a perfunctory,
complimentary yell for their opponents.
They had been beaten where they hoped to win.
Beaten twice in the season by their former victims.
It was humiliating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried Holly Cross. &ldquo;Up with Phil
Clinton. He piloted the team to victory!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; shouted Bricktop. &ldquo;Up with
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Phil was running toward the grandstand
at top speed; toward the A section where, he had
told Tom, Madge and Ruth sat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hurrying to receive the congratulations
of Madge,&rdquo; thought Tom bitterly.</p>

<p>Holly Cross took after the fleeing quarter-back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Phil desperately, and the captain
saw that his face was drawn and strained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; demanded Holly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;read that!&rdquo; and Phil held out a
crumpled telegram. Slowly Holly deciphered it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Come at once. Your mother is dying.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It was signed with Phil&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you get this?&rdquo; asked the captain
slowly, while the other players gathered about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It came just&mdash;just before the game,&rdquo; answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Phil. &ldquo;I must go&mdash;and get my sister. We must
start for Florida&mdash;at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just before the game?&rdquo; said Holly in a low
voice. &ldquo;Just before the game? And you played,
knowing that&mdash;that your mother was&mdash;was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holly faltered. There was a huskiness in his
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I played the game,&rdquo; said Phil simply. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
didn&rsquo;t want to tell you fellows, for fear you&rsquo;d put
a substitute in. But I&rsquo;m going, now,&rdquo; and he turned
toward the grandstand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talk about pluck!&rdquo; exclaimed Holly Cross.
&ldquo;If that isn&rsquo;t the best exhibition of it, I never want
to hear of any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pluck!&rdquo; murmured Bricktop Molloy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
pluck personified. Poor Phil!&rdquo; and the big left-guard
turned aside. Slowly Phil&rsquo;s mates watched
him making his way to where his sister sat. The
gridiron was swarming with spectators now. Bean
Perkins came running over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a great celebration to-night!&rdquo; he
cried to the players and the substitutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Holly Cross simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because Phil&rsquo;s mother is dying. He&rsquo;s got to
go to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up the grandstand leaped Phil. Tom had hurried
after him, ready to do what he could to aid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
his chum to get a train. Phil saw Ruth and Madge
together. At the sight of her brother Ruth cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Phil, wasn&rsquo;t it glorious? I&rsquo;m so glad
you won! Why&mdash;wh&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she
gasped at the sight of his pale face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; he exclaimed huskily. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t&mdash;haven&rsquo;t
you a telegram?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Did you get one, too?&rdquo; and she fumbled
in her muff. &ldquo;Oh, Phil, I&rsquo;m so happy! She&rsquo;s all
better! The operation was a success, and she&rsquo;s
going to get well! I got mine just before the
game, and I supposed you did, too. I was waiting
for you to come to me, but I guess you didn&rsquo;t have
a chance. Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; and she threw her
arms around her brother&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to get well? Operation a success?
Why, I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t get a telegram like that!&rdquo; exclaimed
Phil in bewilderment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; said Ruth, producing it. &ldquo;I
left word to forward any that might come to Fairview
to me here. I gave the number of my seat
here to the Fairview operator, and I got the message
just before play began. But didn&rsquo;t you get
yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Phil could answer a diminutive messenger
boy pushed his way through the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is dis Phil Clinton?&rdquo; he asked boldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; replied Phil quickly, but he hardly
knew what he said.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Den here&rsquo;s a message fer youse. I tried t&rsquo; git
it t&rsquo; youse before de game, but de cop wouldn&rsquo;t let
me in on de grass. So I stayed and seen de scrap.
Hully chee! But it was a peach! I&rsquo;m glad youse
fellers won. Sign dere!&rdquo; and the lad held out his
book with the message in.</p>

<p>As in a dream Phil signed, and then tore open
the envelope. The message was a duplicate of the
one his sister had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any answer?&rdquo; asked the lad, as he gazed in
admiration at Phil, and Tom, who stood close
beside him. &ldquo;Hully chee! But youse is husky
brutes,&rdquo; spoke the modern Mercury, but it was
only his way of properly admiring the football
heroes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s an answer,&rdquo; said Phil, and he
scribbled on a piece of paper a bystander thrust
into his hand this telegram:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Dear Dad: Best news I ever got! We won
the game!&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>And he signed it with the names of his sister
and himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I add my good wishes, not only on the
recovery of your mother, but on the way you played
the game?&rdquo; asked Madge, blushing, and holding
out her hand to Phil. He clasped her fingers in
his.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here!&rdquo; cried Tom, as he caught a roguish
glance from the eyes of Ruth. &ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;m glad
for your sake, old man!&rdquo; and he gave Phil such
a clap on the back as to make the teeth of the
quarter-back clatter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you are,&rdquo; said Phil simply, and as he
shook hands with his chum he knew, somehow,
that the little cloud that had come between them
had passed away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tra, la, la! Merrily do we sing and dance!&rdquo;
cried Tom in the exuberance of his feelings. &ldquo;Come
down on the field, Phil, Madge, Ruth, and we&rsquo;ll
play &lsquo;Ring Around the Rosy&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laughingly they descended with him, and added
to the merriment of the throng by gaily circling
about in it.</p>

<p>But, with all his joy, Phil was puzzled. Where
had the first telegram come from? Had it been
a mistake? Had the operator blundered? He
said nothing to his sister about the message received
just before the game.</p>

<p>The good news quickly spread among the Randall
players, and they soon arranged for a celebration.
A big fire was kindled, on it were thrown
their football suits, for the season was over, and
then the champion eleven broke training. A dinner
was served that night in the gymnasium, and
many girls from Fairview, including Ruth and
Madge, attended.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t understand where this message came
from,&rdquo; Phil was saying to Tom and Sid a few
hours later in their room. &ldquo;Jove, but it almost
knocked me out when I got it! But I knew I had
to play the game.&rdquo; He was examining the telegram
he had first received.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see that message,&rdquo; said Sid, and he
scanned it closely. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fake!&rdquo; he said suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fake!&rdquo; repeated Tom and Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. There&rsquo;s no check number on it. No message
is ever sent out without a check number on
it. This never came over the wire. Some one
got hold of a receiving blank and an envelope, and
played this brutal trick. Maybe it was one of the
Boxer Hall fellows. He wanted to get your nerve,
so you&rsquo;d drop out of the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it was a Boxer Hall chap,&rdquo; said
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it was some one who had a grudge against
you,&rdquo; insisted Sid. &ldquo;We can inquire at the telegraph
office and find out, maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom uttered an exclamation. He had suddenly
thought of the mysterious warning he had received.
Quickly he brought out the torn pieces of
paper. He saw it all now. The warning had
been intended to cover the telegram&mdash;not a physical
danger, but a mental one. Rapidly he explained
how he got the note.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything to you, Phil,&rdquo; he concluded,
&ldquo;because I was&mdash;I was afraid you&rsquo;d laugh
at me. And I kept my eyes open in the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; spoke the quarter-back. &ldquo;But
who sent this warning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid was eagerly examining it, for Tom had
pasted the torn pieces together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; cried Sid. &ldquo;Langridge sent this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; came from Phil and Tom
at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because that&rsquo;s the kind of paper he uses. It
has a peculiar water-mark. I&rsquo;ll show you. I have
an old baseball note I got from him last term.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid brought out his note. The two were compared.
The paper was exactly similar, and there
were even some characteristic similarities in the
writing, though one was in script and the other
printed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Langridge sent this,&rdquo; decided Sid, and the
others agreed with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then who sent the fake telegram?&rdquo; inquired
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerhart, for all the world!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid.
&ldquo;The cad! To play such a brutal trick!&rdquo; Sid
caught up his cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to confront him with this evidence,
and have him run out of college!&rdquo; burst out Sid.
&ldquo;This ends his course!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>But Gerhart had anticipated what was coming,
when he saw that the cruel telegram he had sent
Phil had had no effect, and that the plucky quarter-back
continued playing. He evidently knew the
game was up, and fled. For, when Sid called at
the fashionable eating club, where Gerhart and
Langridge had recently taken a room, he found
only the former &rsquo;varsity pitcher there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Gerhart?&rdquo; asked Sid savagely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; said Langridge, and he began to shake.
He trembled more when Sid threw down the incriminating
evidence, and blurted out the story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all true,&rdquo; confessed Langridge. &ldquo;Gerhart
stole the telegraph blank and an envelope, while I
kept the agent busy talking about some money I
expected to get. Gerhart made me go in the
scheme with him, but I&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t stand it, and
I sent Tom the tip. I&rsquo;m done with Gerhart. He
faked the message to Phil and hired a boy to deliver
it. I&rsquo;m through with him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you would be!&rdquo; burst out Sid,
walking about the room. It was in confusion, for
Gerhart had hurriedly departed. Sid&rsquo;s eye saw
a bottle on the closet shelf. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, Langridge?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s liniment! The same
kind Phil had, and which stiffened my hand! How
did it get here? It&rsquo;s the same bottle that was
broken&mdash;no, it can&rsquo;t be, yet there&rsquo;s the same blot
on the label. How in thunder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Langridge confessed to that trick of Gerhart&rsquo;s
also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ought to be tarred and feathered!&rdquo; cried
the angry Sid. &ldquo;If I had him here! But you&rsquo;re
almost as bad, Langridge. You helped him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it. I&rsquo;m going to leave college, if you&rsquo;ll
only keep still about this. Will you?&rdquo; pleaded the
cringing lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; for the sake of the college, not for you,&rdquo;
spoke Sid, and that is how only the three chums
knew the real story of the dastardly meanness of
the two cronies. They thought they were well rid
of their enemies, but they were mistaken. Those
of you who care to read further of the happenings
at Randall College may do so in the next book,
to be called &ldquo;Batting to Win.&rdquo; In that volume
we shall meet all our friends again, and learn
what Sid did during the greatest baseball game of
the next season, and when the collegiate championship
hung in the balance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all over but the shouting,&rdquo; said Phil
to his chums, as they sat in their room that night.
From without came the joyous cries of those who
were celebrating the football victory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All but putting a bronze tablet in the gym, to
commemorate the pluck you showed,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, forget it!&rdquo; spoke Phil, as he got into a
more comfortable position on the creaking sofa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
&ldquo;Anybody would have done the same to see his
team win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Sid softly as he got up from the
easy chair to look at his favorite football picture.</p>

<p>Then came a silence in the room, and the fussy
little alarm clock had matters all to itself. It
ticked away at a great rate.</p>

<p>Tom, who had been standing near the window,
crossed to the opposite wall, and stood before the
picture of a laughing girl. Phil saw him, smiled,
and then, he, too, slowly arose from the decrepit
sofa and went closer to a photograph of another
girl. Thus the three stood, and the clock ticked on
with quick, impatient strokes, and not a word was
spoken.</p>
